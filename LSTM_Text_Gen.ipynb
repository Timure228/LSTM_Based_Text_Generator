profits of 400m euros 52761m £27473m compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003 operating profits were at 380m euros ten times more than in 2003 lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the iraq war and the killer sars virus it was also hit by troubles at its us catering business last year lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some european and us airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy the board of lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 030 euros per share in 2003 shareholders did not get a dividend the company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 march\\nwinndixie files for bankruptcy\\n\\nus supermarket group winndixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by walmart\\n\\nwinndixie once among the most profitable of us grocers said chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure it said its 920 stores would remain open but analysts said it would most likely offload a number of sites the jacksonville floridabased firm has total debts of 187bn £980m in its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods which it owes 151m\\n\\nanalysts say winndixie had not kept up with consumers demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading a 10month restructuring plan was deemed a failure and following a largerthanexpected quarterly loss earlier this month winndixies slide into bankruptcy was widely expected the companys new chief executive peter lynch said winndixie would use the chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around this includes achieving significant cost reductions improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores he said yet evan mann a senior bond analyst at gimme credit said mr lynchs job would not be easy as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers the real big issue is whats going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers he said\\nus economy still growing says fed\\n\\nmost areas of the us saw their economy continue to expand in december and early january the us federal reserve said in its latest beige book report\\n\\nof the 12 us regions it identifies for the study 11 showed stronger economic growth with only the cleveland area falling behind with a mixed rating consumer spending was higher in december than november and festive sales were also up on 2003 the employment picture also improved the fed said\\n\\nlabour markets firmed in a number of districts but wage pressures generally remained modest the beige book said several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels the report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts office leasing was especially brisk in washington dc and new york city two of the nations strongest commercial markets the fed said\\nsaab to build cadillacs in sweden\\n\\ngeneral motors the worlds largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new mediumsized cadillac bls at its lossmaking saab factory in sweden\\n\\nthe car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the mediumsized luxury car market it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carlpeter forster as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine\\n\\ngms announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factorys closure the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gms planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations but the groups new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the groups opel workers in ruesselsheim germany they may now have to face a larger proportion of gms cuts\\n\\nneither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saabs failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market for years saab has consistently said it is competing headon with bmw mercedes and jaguar the segments leaders do not agree\\n\\ngms plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand  even the presidential limousine carries the badge yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market\\n\\nbringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperatelyneeded scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130000 cars per year that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast  albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m £104m 151m euros from 500m the previous year beyond the 12000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels  badged as vauxhalls in the uk  and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts another way to further reduce saabs losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news the current trend towards us production was stupid he said\\n\\nin a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models it is to deploy a fleet of 35000 test cars across 40 countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24hours it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years\\nbank voted 81 for no rate change\\n\\nthe decision to keep interest rates on hold at 475 earlier this month was passed 81 by the bank of englands ratesetting body minutes have shown\\n\\none member of the banks monetary policy committee mpc  paul tucker  voted to raise rates to 5 the news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates the minutes showed the banks latest inflation report released last week had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending\\n\\nhowever mpc member paul tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5 he argued that economic growth was picking up and that the equity credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected\\n\\nthe banks minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were sufficiently to the downside to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting however the minutes added some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection ross walker uk economist at royal bank of scotland said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon he said the minutes appeared to be trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates if the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates however he added any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year with mpc members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting\\nindustrial revival hope for japan\\n\\njapanese industry is growing faster than expected boosting hopes that the countrys retreat back into recession is over\\n\\nindustrial output rose 21

shrinking gdp only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui despite warning that other indicators  such as the growth numbers  had been worrying\\n\\nwithin the overall industrial output figure there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown among the bestperforming sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars chemicals and electronic goods with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market with products such as flatscreen tvs in high demand during january\\nkhodorkovsky ally denies charges\\n\\na close associate of former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky has told

mr lebedev headed the menatep group the parent company of yukos\\n\\nmr lebedev and mr khodorkovsky who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted will be questioned by a judge over the next few days mr khodorkovsky began his testimony last week telling the court that he objected to the way that the running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction the charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the countrys superrich business leaders the socalled oligarchs yukos has been presented with a 275bn £13bn tax demand by the russian authorities and its key yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill the companys effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the us

continue into 2005 state media report\\n\\nthe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system growth in china remains at a breakneck 91 and corporate investment is growing at more than 25 a year the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9 for more than a year rapid toolingup of chinas manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy  one of the factors which has kept world oil prices skyhigh for most of this year in theory the government has a 7 growth target but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a hard landing in the shape of an overbalancing economy a low exchange rate  chinas yuan is pegged to a rate of 828 to the dollar which seems to be in relentless decline  means chinese exports are cheap on world markets china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg to some extent the credit controls do seem to be taking effect industrial output grew 157 in the year to october down from 23 in february and inflation slowed to 43  although retail sales are still booming\\nverizon seals takeover of mci\\n\\nverizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth 68bn £36bn reports say\\n\\nthe two firms are

longdistance giant att being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for 16bn mci exited bankruptcy in april having gone bust under previous name worldcom the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits\\n\\nshareholders lost about 180bn when the company collapsed while 20000 workers lost their jobs former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an 11bn fraud qwest has itself come under suspicion of substandard behaviour paying the securities and exchange commission 250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy\\n\\nmci is the uss secondbiggest long distance firm after att consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billiondollar telecoms deal since october last week sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer att for about 16bn buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mcis global network and businessbased subscribers the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbcs att deal verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm  factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are

grinds to a halt\\n\\ngrowth in japan evaporated in the three months to september sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decadelong trough\\n\\noutput in the period grew just 01 an annual rate of 03 exports  the usual engine of recovery  faltered while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short the growth falls well short of expectations but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion\\n\\nthe economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums one result was deflation  prices falling rather than rising  which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending\\n\\nthe effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery but high oil prices have knocked 02 off the growth rate while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive\\n\\nthe performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year the first quarter showed annual growth of 63 with the second showing 11 and economists had been predicting as much as 2 this time around exports slowed while capital spending became weaker said hiromichi shirakawa chief economist at ubs securities in tokyo personal consumption looks good but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the

solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms otherwise in five or ten years it will be too late obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire

call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests\\n\\nonce past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20 every year customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says cara diemont of it firm dimension data which commissioned the survey however call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over 5 in 2003 to a record 133 during last year when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher  a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait one possible reason for the lack in patience ms diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones\\n\\nthe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts ms diemont says problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going handinhand with more training the survey found\\n\\nin what dimension data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers this ms diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers as a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff resolution rates  the number of calls where a customers query is resolved to mutual satisfaction  are running at just 50 when the query is passed on to a second or third person  a specialist or manager  rates rise to about 70 but that is still well below the industry target of an 85 resolution rate\\n\\nsuggestions that outsourcing  relocating call centres to lowcost countries like india or south africa  is to blame are wrong ms diemont says\\n\\nthere are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says however companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations only 42 of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution nearly twothirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres they give three key reasons for not making the move\\n\\n call centre operations are part of their business core function \\n  they are worried about the risk of going abroad \\n  they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data and is based on indepth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre did your training prepare you for your job\\nnovartis hits acquisition trail\\n\\nswiss

ids said employer contributions had increased from £55bn to £82bn a year a rise of 497 companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100 or more ids said many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities a final salary scheme also known as a defined benefit scheme promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire\\n\\nthe rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes these are less risky for employers under money purchase schemes employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity  a policy which pays out an income until death  on retirement\\n\\nids said there were some schemes in good health\\n\\nbut in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits the level of contributions paid by employers has

editor of the ids pensions service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new

significant slice chopped off this years profits and a potential pr fiasco noone however seems to have told the stock markets the warning of a fivecent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after

clearly a source of uncertainty for the company  it was a long cruise after all but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as oneoff events\\n\\ndespite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet the uks po princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003 and generally speaking carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion\\n\\nsimilarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises after all the aurora incident may be big news in

slowing markedly city consultancy deloitte has warned\\n\\nthe uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2 this year below chancellor gordon browns forecast of 3 to 35 it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4 by the end of the year\\n\\nin its quarterly economic review deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s\\n\\nbut it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy deloittes chief economic advisor roger bootle said the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace\\n\\neconomic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes deloitte believes gordon brown will need to raise about 10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year when the economy expanded by 325 however deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 475 mark to 35 by

musical director of the oscars show is not for the fainthearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate platespinning assignment\\n\\nthis year marks contis 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess its just a television show but we always think its a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house\\n\\nits a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you dont know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director its exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we dont know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti\\n\\nthe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the shows producers\\n\\nthe decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the directors box to the orchestra via contis earpiece i dont feel good about it at all its not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we dont usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person thats been cut off whos 10 feet from me is glaring at me like its death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only\\n\\nits a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but theres this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and theyre either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met\\n\\nthe image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with theres a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear  different things at different times\\n\\ni have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone thats attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains contis most nervewracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in 1977 when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the shows director i start cursing and screaming i tell him were not going to die for this show  you must do something or im going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and were going to be home in 10 minutes oh no bill dont do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra 60 or so of them in the pit and while were playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died its not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governors ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says im not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day\\nprodigy join v festival

the only point of the programme says ross the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top 40 now you can just click on the internet to find that out so the show has plenty of extra items too the shows reduced reliance upon the top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc vinyl or cassette\\n\\ni personally buy downloads rather than cd singles says 27yearold ross even my grandma can download songs now jk is still struggling with the technology though but its premature for

competent broadcaster\\n\\nthe advantage joel and i have is that were a double act with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive king says wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him and if not i could always use a cleaner he jokes ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show other people can worry about

third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this years event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster\\n\\nthe festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festivals executive director craig prater the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change\\n\\nour premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and 10 of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued but we feel like weve turned a page weve acknowledged our position and now its business as usual\\n\\nmr praters sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festivals sister event the bangkok film market we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nations recovery from this terrible disaster she said\\n\\nhowever the nations recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties\\n\\nthe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leighs abortion drama vera drake that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers\\n\\non a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city problems securing air transport the clash with last sundays golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel\\n\\nbut the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jeanclaude van damme irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festivals golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after decembers catastrophe i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said i thought it might be in rather bad taste but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on now ive come here im very glad what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued basically i was invited here by thailand if they still want you to come you should\\n\\nnow in its third year bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong tokyo and pusan in south korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal its grown awfully fast in three years  maybe too fast he concedes weve had some bumps in the road but thats only because the festival is still a baby i have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian film festival in

julia\\n\\nbening who was born in texas in 1958 has gained prominence for a string of key roles although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for benings role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999s american beauty but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swanks leading role in boys dont cry after opening her career in the theatre  and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986  bening had a lowkey spell in television she then made her film debut as a sexstarved wife in 1988s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy\\n\\nfollowing a cameo in postcards from the edge benings breakthrough role came in 1990 playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters  a role that won her an oscar nomination despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award\\n\\nhowever the highprofile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions costarring with some of hollywoods greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations\\n\\nbugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening  she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe the couple now have four children together a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered benings career in the mid1990s she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeares richard iii\\n\\nbening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success  but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance but current film being julia has made bening an awardwinning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva  played by bening  grow tired of her success and fall for a young american  and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award\\noscars steer clear of controversy\\n\\nthe oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema\\n\\nif best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the frontrunners would have had to be michael moores bushbaiting documentary fahrenheit 911 and mel gibsons the passion of the christ both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them  fahrenheit 911 breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than us370m £196m in the us alone but this years academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ  a film accused of being antisemitic  receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score\\n\\nfahrenheit 911 has also been overlooked despite winning the palme dor at the cannes international film festival in 2004\\n\\nmoores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moores film does not sit well with the academy if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epicstyle pictures fahrenheit 911 didnt really fit in to that category they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often arent too contentious he said while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moores film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category i think its more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he said\\n\\nthe problem with mel gibsons film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language\\n\\nhollywood doesnt tend to like foreignlanguage films  noones ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semimythical historical monster but mr dams said its not an inflammatory film it has done very well in germany and its a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm\\n\\nindependent filmmaker morgan spurlock may have forced fastfood giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a monthlong diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals  and filmed his progress\\n\\nthe film has been a hit around the world mr dams said its a political film but its quite fun and punky and wellpaced morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy its a very accessible film and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views while in fahrenheit 911 there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together  the fact its a very likeable film  means its won through on charm dams pick at this years oscars the aviator martin scorseses biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes tinseltown it seems likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own\\nvan gogh festival film withdrawn\\n\\nmurdered director theo van goghs controversial film submission has been

put chocolate on the biscotti  you need two 12x15 inch approx cookie sheets  butter and flour one of the cookie sheets  the oven should be at 350 to roast the almonds and 300 to bake the biscotti  total baking time for the biscotti is about 2 hours  you also need to have handy and ready a surface for kneading the biscotti dough and a surface for cutting the baked biscotti  roast the almonds in a 350 degree often until lightly browned 1015 minutes  cool nuts completely lower the oven temperature to 300  in a medium bowl stir together the dry ingredients flour sugar baking soda salt just to

well in the flour mixture in the medium bowl and pour in the eggvanilla mixture  stir the flour into the egg mixture from the outside of the well  continue combining until the mixture is too stiff to

portions and shape each portion into an even 12inchthick patty use your thumb to make a shallow indentation in the center of each patty this helps the burgers cook more evenly transfer the patties to a plate and set aside\\nto make the guacamole place the avocado in a small bowl and with the back of a fork mash it until it’s almost smooth add the tomato the remaining cilantro and the lime juice season with salt and stir to combine\\nheat a grill pan or outdoor grill to mediumhigh about 375°f to 425°f when the grill is hot use tongs to grab several layers of wadded paper towels dip them in vegetable oil and smear the grill pan’s ridges or outdoor grill’s grates you can also apply cooking spray directly to the pan or grates\\nuse a metal spatula to transfer the turkey patties to the pan or grill close the lid if it’s the latter and cook undisturbed don’t be tempted to press down on the patties until grill marks appear on the bottom about 5 to 6 minutes flip the burgers close the grill if using and cook until the patties are cooked through and an instantread thermometer registers 165°f about 6 minutes more add the cheese to the top of each patty for the last 4 minutes of cooking time when the cheese melts transfer the burgers to a warmed plate and tent loosely with foil for 5 minutes meanwhile split and toast the buns on the grill\\ntop each bottom bun with a turkey

supplement the benefits of chocolate\\nthe more scientists learn about chocolate the more amazing chocolate seems what are the benefits of chocolate aside from the feeling of satisfaction that only chocolate can bring heres a short list of the benefits of chocolate\\n\\n1 chocolate according to recent research may provide a mental boost by elevating blood flow to the brain the effect of this is that chocolate may be good for improving ones memory and attention and may be helpful for speeding up reaction times\\n\\n2 chocolate may be good for the skin a german study found that women who were given chocolate cocoa every day for a period of three months had skin that was moister and softer possibly as a result of improved blood circulation\\n\\n3 chocolate may provide some level of protection against heart disease researchers have found that dark chocolate consumption reduces hypertension reduces cholesterol levels and adds protection against blood clots\\n\\n4 lastly chocolate seems to make people feel better for athletes this may come in the form of improved recovery times after periods of exertion and for women this may come in the form of an improved sexual experience chocolate does seem to be an aphrodesiac in its own righthow you cook fish may affect your risk of stroke\\nfish seems to be synonymous with healthy eating however how you cook fish may determine how much benefit you get from its consumption and this may be particularly true for older individuals\\n\\na study conducted by dr daariush mozaffarian found that elderly individuals who consumed more tuna and other types of fish experienced a lower risk of stroke incidence\\n\\nhowever the level of stroke occurrence varied partly according to whether or not the fish was fried or nonfried individuals who ate tuna and nonfried fish 14 times per week lowered their risk of stroke by 27 percent while those who consumed tuna and nonfried fish at least five times per week decreased their risk of stroke by 30 percent\\n\\nindividuals who consumed fried fish did not seem to gain any advantage from eating fish their risk of stroke was actually fortyfour percent higher if they ate fried fish more than one time per week\\n\\ncan using olive oil reduce the risk of cancer \\ncancer rates are reportedly higher in areas of northern europe as compared to southern europe and it is in southern europe where olive oil is an important dietary component is there a connection between lower rates of cancer and the use of olive oil a danish team of researchers from the copenhagen university hospital conducted a study to investigate the matter\\n\\nthe danish study involved 182 men between the ages of twenty and sixty originating from five separate european nations in the course of the study researchers added olive oil to their daily diet for a period of two weeks the goal was to measure any appreciable effect on the produced levels of a substance known as 8oxodg which correlates with cellular damage as a result of oxidation\\n\\nthe result at the end of the two week period the study participants were found to have thirteen percent less 8oxodg in their urine suggesting the potential for reduced levels of dna damage dna damage can lead to the development of cancer as a result of using olive oil\\ncan drinking tea lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of heart disease \\naccording to the results of a german study there may be something to this the study found that drinking black tea had a significant effect on artery dilation the ability of arteries to dilate or expand is important to the maintenance of normal blood pressure levels\\n\\nhow can the consumption of black tea protect against high blood pressure the researchers found that molecular substances in black tea known as catechins help to expand arteries by producing nitric oxide\\n\\ninterestingly enough many british tea drinkers may be unknowingly giving up the heart health benefits of tea how is this the case the german study group found that adding milk to tea the habit of most british tea drinkers introduces caseins caseins are proteins found in milk that block the ability of catechins to dilate blood vessels\\n\\t\\ndoes green tea prevent certain types of cancers \\napparently a few scientists in spain and britain think this may be the case researchers in both countries have been able to show that a specific compound found in green tea known as egcg the ap article on green tea did not disclose what this acronym actually stands for has the ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells\\n\\negcg seems to accomplish the remarkable feat of preventing cancer cell growth by inhibiting a particular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and according to a professor roger thorneley of the john innes center in norwich england this is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anticancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by egcg\\n\\nthe wonderful news for green tea afficionados of course is that green tea contains about five times as much egcg as regular tea\\n\\nhowever as professor thorneley states so far there has been no determination as to how much green tea an individual would need to consume to obtain the beneficial effects provided by this compound\\n\\nbut since he also goes on record to state that egcg may be just one of several ingredients in green tea that have such properties theres certainly no reason to stop drinking green tea\\n\\nunless you are a pregnant woman that is women who are pregnant are given the advice that folic acid supplements may protect newborns against spina bifida apparently green tea if consumed in large amounts can have the effect of decreasing folic acids effectiveness\\nthe antioxidant properties of chocolate\\nif youre curious as to where chocolate comes from and what its health benefits may be the following article may help answer some of these questions as well as other questions such as\\n\\ncan eating chocolate boost antioxidant levels\\n\\ndoes chocolate contain flavonoids not an everyday question but the article does address it\\n\\nis one form of chocolate superior to other forms\\n\\nreaders who have an interest in the health benefits of chocolate of course may not be surprised to read that dark chocolate is the healthiest choice while adding milk to chocolate either in the form of milk chocolate or by drinking liquid milk while eating chocolate has the effect of diluting some of chocolates natural benefits\\n\\nof course as healthy as chocolate may be the fact that it is usually in most forms laden with sugar and high calories makes it a food item whose consumption should be rationed\\n\\nhowever there are sugar free forms of chocolate available most notably the various products produced by the russell stover company the only downside to these are that many individuals do not do well with the artificial sugar alcohol sweeteners that are currently in use from a first hand perspective i can inform you that gastric distress and flatulence are two of the unfortunate side effects of eating these types of treatsthough this affects different individuals in varying levels of intensityeating meat comes with a higher risk for developing cancer\\na reuters article appearing on msnbccom cites a new study that for the first time shows a definite link between meat consumption and certain types of cancer including colorectal cancer liver cancer esophageal cancer pancreatic cancer and lung cancer\\n\\nthe study involved five hundred thousand individuals between the ages of fiftyone and seventy after an eightyear period 53396 individual diagnoses of cancer were made\\n\\nin such a large study focusing on this particular age range that number may not seem significant however the researchers were able to able to find high statistical correlations between meat particularly red meat consumption and the incidence of the aforementioned cancers\\n\\nto use one example those individuals whose processed meat consumption placed them in the top twenty percent of meat eatershad a twenty percent higher risk for developing colorectal cancer and a sixteen percent higher risk for developing lung canceromega3 fatty acids  its not hype\\nthere is a plethora of nutrition information out there and much of it unfortunately focuses on claims that range from the dubious to the preposterous\\n\\nlately the buzz is all about omega3’s and our deficiency in this micro nutrient while you may want to ignore all the nutrition propaganda in the headlines a recent article states that you should listen to and head the information about omega3’s \\n\\nthe article written by citynewsca referenced the study “fish consumption fish oil omega3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease” which was released by the american heart association in 2002 the study showed tremendous evidence that omega3’s decreased triglyceride levels decreased the risk of arrhythmias lowered blood pressure and decreased growth rates of atherosclerotic plaques\\n\\nomega3 fatty acids are also thought to offer positive and potentially healing effects for medical conditions such as lupus multiple sclerosis menstrual pain crohn’s disease rheumatoid arthritis and migraines\\n\\nto get your dose of omega3’s eat plenty of fresh wild salmon sardines cod herring krill oil anchovies and mackerel some dairy products also add omega3’s check labels to find the healthiest dairy products though\\n\\nif you are a vegetarian you can get your omega3’s from omega3 eggs and if you are vegan or follow a lactoovo vegetarian diet good sources of this nutrient include flaxseed pecans walnuts and hazelnutsorganic food really is healthier\\nfor the longest time advocates of organic food have had to deal with the naysayers a lot of people still think that organic food is mostly hype and a way to charge more money for practically the same items they fail to recognize the benefits of richer cleaner soil and the lack of pesticides and genetically modified chemicals\\n\\nthe truth is that organic foods really are more nutritious and they actually do taste better a study conducted by newcastle university and funded by the european union found that organic food contains higher levels of antioxidants and flavonoids less unhealthy fats as well as higher levels of valuable minerals\\n\\nthe study also found that organic milk had 50 to 80 more antioxidants than milk from nonorganic cattle and that many organic foods from onions and cabbage to potatoes and wheat had 20 to 50 more minerals than nonorganic varieties\\n\\nthe researchers are still trying to find out what the logical difference is to produce

people know fish oil is a healthy source of fat a recent study suggests that it may also reduce fatty substances found in the blood of those with type 2 diabetes\\n\\nthe study which studied over 40 adults taking a supplement with 4 grams of fish oil over 8 weeks proved that it lowered levels of traicylglycerol a fatty substance that contributes to heart disease\\n\\nthey also found that levels of hdl good cholesterol rose with those who took fish oil\\n\\nthe study was reported in the diabetes care magazine and reported that those taking fish oil supplements showed ldl and hdl feel by almost 1 that might not be a lot but for diabetics reducing the amount of fat in the blood by any amount is helpful\\n\\nwhile taking fish oil supplements is helpful eating fatty fish like salmon and mackerel is the natural way to get plenty of fish oilsthe juice from seabuckthorn berries\\nseabuckthorn berries may produce a juice so rich in vitamins and antioxidants that it may be considered a tonic for the heart\\n\\nmost of us have never even heard of a seabuckthorn bush let alone the fact that the berries of this plant are a potential tonic for our hearts well these berries do exist and they are filled with cholesterol reducing compounds that may prevent arteries from clogging\\n\\nseabuckthorn berries are found from the atlantic coast of europe to china although seabuckthorn bushes seem to thrive in the semi arid deserts of central asia\\n\\nthe juice of seabuckthorn berries has long been used in china tibet mongolia and russia as a health drink due to the acidic nature of the berries they are not pleasant to eat however when mixed with other sweet juices such as apple or grape they are much more palatable for our consumption this juice is full of vitamin c vitamin e amino acids and minerals that may prevent bad cholesterol from becoming oxidized thus reducing an individual’s risk of coronary artery disease\\n\\nrecently a new process has been developed to extract the juice of the seabuckthorn berry that allows forty percent of the original polyphenol fifty percent of the flavonoids and seventy percent of the vitamin c to remain in the juice the improvement in the extraction process may enable the juice to become more marketable for western consumers as a preventative tonic for the heartfirat güder admits it albeit a bit chagrined he often leaves unopened yogurt in his office at room temperature for several weeks before he eats it so far he’s escaped any ill effects “they’re still good to eat” he said “i have not gotten sick from them yet of course i don’t suggest other people do this”\\n\\ngüder assistant professor in the department of bioengineering at imperial college london knows maybe he’s just been lucky like many consumers he thinks about food safety but tries to keep his perspective about the risks “i do throw away items myself but usually just use the ‘useby’ dates as a reference point” he said “i do not solely rely on them”\\n\\nhes

considered fresh nevertheless dates on packaging confuse people and often prompt many shoppers to toss food thats still safe and wholesome to eat\\n\\ngüder thinks he’s come up with an idea that will help solve this problem he’s invented an inexpensive sensor that can be embedded in a smartphone and held up against a food package at home or in the store to detect whether the food is still fresh

researchers prescribed and controlled every single meal plus the amount of daily exercise the participants got for the first two weeks half of the group ate a diet rich in veggies whole grains and other unprocessed food while the other half ate ultraprocessed stuff every meal contained twice as many calories as the person would actually need to maintain their body weight and everyone was told to eat as much or as little as they wanted then the groups swapped menus for the last two weeks of the study which was published this week in the journal cell metabolism\\n\\nthe most important part of this study though is that the meals were matched on their macros whether you were on the processed or unprocessed week each meal had roughly the same number of carbs fat protein fiber sugar and total calories the researchers couldn’t match more specific categories like added sugar or saturated fat simply because it’s hard to find chips and fruit juice that are as low in those unhealthy nutrients as whole foods are\\n\\nevery day doctors write prescriptions for medications that will treat various ailments in their patients those prescriptions though come once the patient is already sick in an effort to stop disease before it starts some researchers are pushing for policies and programs that would let doctors prescribe healthy foods and insurers to cover them—actively helping patients shift to a healthpromoting diet\\n\\nthese types of programs work subsidizing fruits vegetables and other healthy foods under medicare and medicaid could prevent millions of cases as well as deaths from cardiovascular disease according to a new model it would prevent hundreds of thousands of diabetes cases as well and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs\\n\\n“the power of food as medicine is increasingly clear” says study author dariush mozaffarian dean of the friedman school of nutrition science and policy at tufts university and the idea of treating food as a key element of healthcare is catching on across the healthcare industry says rita nguyen assistant health officer in the san francisco department of public health “people are recognizing the common sense of it all” she says “we spend so much on healthcare and our outcomes are abysmal we don’t invest in prevention”\\n\\nfood as medicine doesn’t mean that individual foods can be used to treat individual conditions or diseases but that a healthy diet can help manage disease nguyen notes—the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease for example is poor diet “with food insecurity treating someone by giving them food can improve health for those who are food secure anyone given a good diet will have improved health management” she saysthe new model analyzed the effects of two policy scenarios in the first 30 percent of the costs of fruits and vegetables would be covered under medicare and medicaid in the second 30 percent of fruits vegetables and other healthy foods like whole grains and seafood would be covered the model incorporated things like socioeconomic demographics and health risk factors of people enrolled in medicare and medicaid data on the way price decreases change healthy food purchasing behaviors and subsidy costs\\n\\nthe study team found that subsidizing fruits and vegetables would prevent 193 million cardiovascular events like heart attacks and 350000 deaths from the conditions subsidizing fruits vegetables and other healthy foods would prevent 328 million cardiovascular events 620000 deaths and 120000 cases of diabetes the fruits and vegetables program would save nearly 40 billion in healthcare costs and the addition of other healthy foods would save over 100 billion\\n\\n“it costs money but most of that is offset by lower healthcare costs” mozaffarian says “when you look at the cost per year of life saved all of the interventions were extremely cost effective” it’s just as cost effective he says as paying for drugs to prevent high blood pressurethe conversations around healthfocused food subsidies also highlights that the barriers to healthy food are largely financial food security is a money issue nguyen says if you have the money you can get healthy food while food deserts are important issues theyre not the primary hurdle—and research shows that simply adding grocery stores doesnt increase peoples consumption of healthy food or their health its not to say access isnt an issue but often times in low income communities its not the main thing she says\\n\\nfood prescription and subsidy programs that lower costs though can help and are designed to stop healthcare problems and costs from ever appearing “if our social structures aren’t aligned to support people meeting their basic needs to support health we’ve chosen to pay for it in other ways and then we have worse health outcomes” nguyen says\\n\\nin other words if we’re worried about high blood sugar food interventions might be a better bet than doctors visits and hightech medicine if we’re focused on making sure people are getting their blood sugar levels checked regularly she says it’s already too late “access to healthcare isn’t going to really stop the source”increasing the amount of ultraprocessed foods that you eat also shortens your life according to a new study the research published in jama internal medicine tracked nearly 45000 french men and women over eight years it found that for every 10 percent increase in the amount of ultraprocessed foods the participates ate risk of death went up 1 percent\\n\\nultraprocessed foods fall at the far end of the nova food classification system which breaks what you eat down into four categories unprocessed foods edible parts of plants and animals processed ingredients like oils flour or sugar processed foods which involve cooking unprocessed foods with processed ingredients to make breads or canned vegetables and ultraprocessed foods which dont have any intact unprocessed parts\\n\\nthese ultraprocessed foods are mostly made from substances derived from other foods preservatives and additives—designed to create convenient and longlasting products both processed and ultraprocessed foods can add excess sugars oils and fats to a diet notes claire berryman an assistant professor in the department of nutrition food and exercise sciences at florida state university ultraprocessed foods though take the amount to the next level—and also contain additives and other highly manufactured ingredients\\n\\nthe jama internal medicine cant say that these foods caused an earlier death just that theyre associated with an early death its not possible therefore to say what exactly in these foods contributes to the problems however the high amounts of badforyou ingredients are likely to play a role berryman says anytime youre getting an excess of sugar fat or salt there can be problems heres whats hiding in the packagingover the past few years major food companies like cocacola general mills and hershey signaled an interest in combating their images as junkfood giants—they’ve been introducing healthier products cutting sugar and promoting exercise\\n\\nhowever these food giants havent changed their advertising practices to match with those causes according to a new report from the university of connecticut rudd center for food policy  obesity in addition their product promotion continues to disproportionately affect black and hispanic children and teenagers whom the companies target specifically with junk food ads these groups are more likely to see more of these ads than their white counterparts\\n\\n“companies say that they want to be part of the solution to obesity and the overconsumption of unhealthy foods” says jennifer harris report author and director of marketing initiatives at the rudd center “but they are still overwhelmingly using ads to push unhealthy stuff and their disproportionately targeting black and hispanic youth”\\n\\nusing market research data the team examined advertising spending in 2017 in total as well as advertising spending for spanishlanguage and blacktargeted television in 32 brands including mcdonald’s hershey kellogg and dominos pizza they also looked at black white and hispanic children and teen’s exposure to foodrelated advertisingthe analysis shows that of the billions of dollars spent on advertising only 3 percent of that money went to promote healthier food products like 100 percent juice water nuts or yogurt black and hispanic viewers were far less likely to be targeted with healthier advertising—healthy food made up just 1 percent of food advertising on blacktargeted television “no water fruit or nut brands targeted either hispanic or black consumers” the report noted\\n\\nalthough companies don’t disclose their marketing strategies statements they do release shows that they see hispanic and or “multicultural” groups as important marketing opportunities the report said “but it seems only unhealthy brands are a marketing opportunity” harris says\\n\\nthe findings build on the rudd center’s 2015 report that looked at advertising practices in 2013 and shows that the data has largely stayed the same since then “we’re not surprised but we did expect we might see some improvement especially in healthy products” harris says “not much has changed

their spending on blacktargeted television between 2013 and 2017 and hershey pepsico and domino’s pizza dedicated the biggest chunk—around 4 percent—of their advertising budget to that group\\n\\nin addition the gap widened between the number of foodrelated advertisements black and white children and teens saw in 2013 black children and teens saw 70 percent more ads than white peers and in 2017 that grew to 86 percent while the amount of ad spending on blacktargeted television might have contributed to the growing gap it also might be due to the changing amount of time the groups spend watching television “the amount of time spent watching tv is going down but the declines are much greater for white teens than black teens” harris says\\n\\nsocioeconomic factors might contribute to that discrepancy she says wealthier white communities might be more likely to pay for and watch television on services like hulu or netflix “that’s great but if you’re in a lower income household you might not able to afford that”\\nresearch shows that kids consume more junk food when theyre exposed to junk food advertising and that ads help solidify brand preferences in children—so if black and hispanic kids have more exposure to these ads theyre more likely to eat more unhealthy food companies would argue that theyre not increasing consumption of sugary drinks overall or fast food overall harris says but when sugary drinks are marketed it grows the whole category not just the one product\\n\\nblack and hispanic communities are already disproportionately affected by certain diseases that are exacerbated by an overconsumption of junk food so the advertising targets compound an existing public health problem\\n\\n“these companies are targeting kids in communities where their families have higher rates of obesity and diabetes and heart disease which these products contribute to” harris says “they’re not even trying to market healthy foods to these kids which doubles down on it being unhealthy i’m sure they’re not thinking of it that way they’re trying to grow their business but looking at the bigger picture it’s really harmful”food allergies can be confusing to figure out once a food item has wrecked havoc on any part of your body whether its an itchy rash or a bout of diarrhea its easy to dismiss that reaction as an allergy but how many of us actually have true food allergies a recent study suggests that number is far less than what you might think\\n\\neven though common wisdom holds that allergies of all kinds have been on the rise in recent years researchers actually have very little data on allergies in adults since many of them never get diagnosed by a physician some studies have attempted to use hospitalization data as a proxy but that only picks up people with sufficiently serious allergies to go to the er for anaphylaxis another study used data from nhanes a massive national survey study that occurs every few years to look at actual blood test results\\n\\none study in the journal jama network open took a far broader approach and focused solely on food allergies researchers based out of northwestern university surveyed some 40443 american adults and asked them a series of questions designed to figure out how many people actually had food allergies versus how many just thought they did their findings although one in five people surveyed reported having an allergy only about one in 10 actually does\\n\\nto understand how they came to this conclusion we first have to understand the difference between a true food allergy and a food intolerance both of which can seem similar to the untrained eyelet’s start with an example pretty much everyone is familiar with dairy most people know someone who’s lactose intolerant these individuals lack the enzyme lactase to varying degrees that allows them to break down lactose the sugar in milk if they consume a large amount of lactosecontaining dairy the undigested lactose builds up in the gut causing uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and diarrhea until the stuff passes through the digestive tract though uncomfortable that gastrointestinal distress is never lifethreatening as such they can absolutely drink a milkshake though they will likely pay for it later\\n\\non the other hand you probably dont know someone with a milk allergy because thats much less common but if you do you know they cant drink milkshakes thats because they have a true allergy which means the root of the problem is not in their digestive systems but rather in their immune systems allergists call these responses igemediated because well theyre mediated by a protein called immunoglobulin e ige is an antibody that your immune system produces whose job it is to identify intruders like parasites people with allergies accidentally produce ige molecules that identify harmless proteins like those in peanuts shellfish or milk as being dangerous that means upon ingestion ige are like the alarm that kicks up a massive immune response recruiting histamines and other immune cells that kill the invader its this overreaction that causes your throat to close or your blood pressure to drop precipitously or any of the other allergic symptoms that transcend one bodily organ and extend into the respiratory system or perhaps the skin or cardiovascular system this response can absolutely be life threateningnot everyone with a true food allergy will have the same symptoms but they will all be governed by ige conversely people with food intolerances like lactose intolerance only get digestive symptoms and listen were not here to dismiss the severity of your gi issues if youre in genuine pain after you eat dairy shellfish or eggs it might be best for you to avoid them but when allergists are counting people with food allergies theyre not counting you as the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology notes these kinds of food intolerances are caused by enzyme deficiencies or some sensitivity to particular chemicals in food natural or otherwise allergies rather must invoke the immune systempotential confounding factors—like high income or physical activity level—are especially important when studying the health benefits of organic food because eating organic is associated with lots of things that also help you live a longer healthier life in other words people who regularly eat organic food tend to have other lifestyle factors and habits that could easily lower cancer risk as well even within just this one study high organic food consumption was associated with higher income higher occupational status a better job like being a manager or working an intellectual office job more physical activity eating more fruits and veggies and eating less meat and processed food those are all things that make you more likely to stay healthy than those who cant afford to take such good care of themselves\\n\\nand on top of those potential confounders its very easy for people to misreport how much and what kind of food they really eat organic food intake is notoriously difficult to assess notes an accompanying editorial in jama and its selfreport is highly susceptible to confounding by positive health behaviors and socioeconomic factors\\n\\nthe researchers can try to control for these issues which means doing statistical analysis to try to figure out the effect of organic food with all other factors being equal but the problem with confounders is that its very difficult to control for all of themdiets are everywhere but could eating “negative calorie” foods such as celery and grapefruit help to boost weight loss a calorie is a unit of energy usually expressed as kilocalories kcal for the energy content in food the theory behind negative calorie foods is that some foods have lower calorie energy content than the amount of energy it takes to digest and absorb the food into the body this sounds plausible in theory but in reality even the lowest calorie foods such as celery contain more calories than it takes to break down and absorb them in the body our energy needs are made up of three components • the energy needed to maintain a body at rest which is the energy needed for our body to carry out its basic processes so we can live • the thermic effect of eating which is the increase in metabolic rate after eating while food is digested and absorbed • additional energy needed for activity and exercise\\n\\nof these the thermic effect uses the fewest calories—about 10 of the energy we take in in other words about a tenth of the calories we eat are used to process our food—this includes chewing our food moving it through the digestive system absorbing nutrients and storing excess energy\\n\\nfoods such as celery grapefruit broccoli tomatoes and cucumber have all been touted as negative calorie foods but there is no scientific evidence to support this idea although they are very low calorie foods with seven to 30 kcal per 100g it still takes less energy than this to process them this is because they contain large amounts of water and fiber which have a very low energy costyouve probably heard a lot of mixed things about coffee—its bad its good it doesnt do anything—but the bulk of the evidence says drinking joe is good for you cardiologists think some of the health benefits may come from the antioxidants in coffee like polyphenols but its been difficult to link the effects to any specific compound the polyphenolic antioxidants seem to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism insulin is how your body tames spiking blood glucose levels and when the system gets out of whack you can develop larger metabolic problems like type two diabetes\\n\\nmost of the reassurance that coffee is part of a healthy diet comes from observational studies where researchers ask a large number of people to describe their eating and coffee drinking habits and then find associations between consuming coffee and heart health those studies have found that drinking somewhere around three to five cups a day reduces your overall risk of death as well as your risk of cardiovascular disease java also doesn’t seem to have any significant impact on arrhythmias hypertension blood lipid levels or cholesterol but it does decrease your risk of developing type two diabetes\\n\\nall that being said the thing that’s not healthy about many americans’ coffee habits is the sugar coffeeflavored drinks or simple drip coffee with tons of sugar added are counterproductive the sugar and calories in them work against the hearthealthy black coffee so try to drink your morning cup with as few adulterating other ingredients as possible\\n\\nnot even the most optimistic of nutritionists thinks youll never touch a piece of cake again we may assume those who teach people to eat for a living would believe in the elimination of all junk food but the reality is that even the pros know youll cave sometimes and thats okay you just gotta have a plan\\n\\neating is a restofyourlife thing says teresa fung a professor of nutrition at simmons college that means whatever your diet plan is she and other nutritionists want you to be able to stick with it longterm unless you have godlevel willpower youre not going to be able to resist sugar forever—and in fact nutritionists dont want you to fung explains that regardless of the diet you pick if you go off of it once youve lost whatever weight you want to shed youll just end up gaining it back later and losing the benefit of dieting in the first place its far better for your longterm health to learn how to make better choices than it is to diet intermittently\\n\\nhere are a few tips that fung recommends to eat healthily while still making room for your favorite cookiesif cutting down on calories is your primary goal you might be tempted to skip other food in order to make room for your unhealthy treats in the plan but fung says this is a mistake because your selfcontrol is at its lowest when youre hungry your blood sugar levels have dropped which means your brain isnt at its most rational and youre probably in a bad mood this is when youre most likely to overindulge thats why fung says junk is for once youre full\\n\\nobviously no one is suggesting you go to town on some ice cream when youre already full to bursting from a meal of veggies—you can save some room for the good stuff but if you make sure to eat treats after real food instead of when youre super hungry you’ll make better choices about which foods to eat plus your ghrelin levels the hormone that makes you feel hungry will have dropped which will decrease your overall desire to eatso it’s unclear how many americans will actually be looking to avoid gm food in the future but even if you want to keep your pantry gmofree doing so could prove challenging\\n\\n“can people avoid them the answer is certainly yes especially in the last few years there have been more products on the market that are nongmo or organic” says jayson lusk an economist at purdue university who studies the consumer side of gmos “now those products are more expensive—no one ever said you can avoid them for free but they can if they’re willing and able to pay and one way they’ll pay is in the time to find the products”\\n\\nthough very few fruits and vegetables are genetically engineered he points out that almost anything with corn or soybeans will be difficult to get without a gm component more than 90 percent of both crops are bioengineered in the us and corn and soy derivatives go into many processed foods much of the sugar produced derives from sugar beets nearly all of which are genetically engineered somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of processed

ingredients like high fructose corn syrup have little to no traceable dna in them and so the us department of agriculture which regulates food labels doesn’t require manufacturers to add a label to indicate those bioengineered foods\\n\\nand then there’s that word—”bioengineered” the usda only just announced how they would require manufacturers to disclose gm ingredients though the law was enacted back in 2016 and the new rules don’t use the term “gmo” or even “gm” instead they opt for “be” or “bioengineered” perhaps to avoid using loaded terminology “i’m not sure how much people will know that term” says dominique brossard a communications professor at university of wisconsinmadison specializing in life science issues like gmos “i don’t think it’s going to be very easy for people to find out which foods are genetically modified”\\n\\ni think this was actually the intent of the 2016 law says glenn stone an environmental anthropologist who studies the gmo debate it was passed just in time to overrule a statelevel law was taking effect requiring that gmo foods have clear labels vermont had previously passed legislation that would have fined companies for failing to label food containing gm ingredients including highly processed ones like corn syrup though it excluded cheese which often relies on a genetically engineered enzyme called chymosin it also specified that the labels would include the phrase genetic engineering not bioengineeredn contrast the usda regulations allow companies to choose between three options write out the warning as in contains a bioengineered food ingredient include a be label or use a qr code that would link the consumer to a page disclosing all the information\\n\\nstone along with other labeling proponents argue that these options will make it harder for people to actually get the information the legislation is supposed to mandate “this rule claims to label gmo foods but it exempts the most common gmo food ingredients like soy oil and corn syrup while allowing the use of qr codes” he says “knowing perfectly well that few shoppers have the time or inclination to get out their phone scan a code and read a website over and over while shopping”\\n\\nunless those regulations change though it could be quite hard to figure out exactly which foods contain gm ingredients and which do not many of the top gm crops grown for human consumption—maize soybeans canola sugar beet papaya squash eggplant potato and apples—get processed first and wouldnt require a label the rest if sold whole or as part of another food would necessitate one a recent overview of attitudes towards gm foods published in the journal annual reviews commented that since soybeans and corn the most widely planted ge crops are common ingredients in many food products corn starch corn syrup corn oil and soybean oil it is likely that foods in the united states listing soybeans and corn as ingredients contain some ge ingredients unless it is specifically stated that they do notif theres one meal guaranteed to meet the needs of picky toddlers harried parents and broke college students alike its macncheese whether you prefer the classic stuff in the blue box or the organic brand famous for its pasta bunnies you probably realize that macncheese isnt healthy exactly but given the fast food alternatives we tell ourselves its isnt that bad and yet because everything we love is secretly conspiring to kill us a recent report suggests that each serving of americas favorite processed cheese food also serves up a hefty dose of phthalates a class of chemicals increasingly thought to interfere with the bodys hormones but does this mean that you should give up eating that orange goo\\n\\nphthalates which includes chemicals such as di2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and diethyl phthalate dep help make rigid plastics more flexible and less breakable in cosmetics phthalates help chemical components better bind to each other unfortunately a growing body of research links them to genital birth defects the disruption of some hormones learning disabilities and behavioral problems\\n\\nthanks to a 2008 bill phthalates are now banned in the production of children’s products like toys but theyre still abundant you’ll find phthalates in vinyl flooring aftershave nail polish and increasingly in food although their presence there isn’t completely understood it’s thought that some foods packaged in materials containing phthalates including cellophane paperboard and plastics pick the chemicals up as they sit on your shelves tasty\\n\\nbefore delving into the macncheese report that is currently making the rounds its important to note that unless youre raising cows yourself with a feed youre making yourself and handmilking said cow into glass containers almost all dairy products you consume contain phthalates in fact you might do all of the aforementioned dairy farming and still find that your milk contains the chemicals a 2013 study in the journal environment international tracked the progression of eight different phthalates through the food chain and determined that basically every step of the milk production process helps introduce phthalates into the end resultif youre feeling smug because you dont consume meat or animal products you may be discouraged to discover that phthalates are also found in fruits and vegetables albeit at lower concentrations this is not a question of a single product being bad but rather a symptom of an unhealthy food production system\\n\\nwhich brings us to the macncheese report which is not a peer reviewed study this means that outside scientists havent been able to weigh in on the study methods design or conclusions while it was conducted by an independent lab it was done so at the behest of a host of environmental groups—including the national resources defense council earth justice center for science in the public interest and others—under the notexactlysubtle consortium name klean up kraft additionally the report is heavily redacted the specific brands they tested arent referenced and there are some discrepancies between the report and the summary sheet released to the media the report for example says that they tested 51 samples while the summary sheet reports that they tested 30 for simplicitys sake im referencing data from the summary sheet\\n\\nthe summary sheet says that phthalates were detected in nearly every cheese product tested—29 out of 30—and that average phthalate levels were four times higher in the powdered stuff than in hard blocks and other cheeses it also reports that the most commonly detected phthalates were bis2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp which is used to make plastic more flexible and diethyl phthalatedep which is most commonly used to bind cosmetics and fragrances all of which suggests that you should give up macncheese rightnaturally there are some caveats the first is that our understanding of phthalates is still evolving so its possible that the acceptable threshold may decrease as we learn more and its true that the important thing may not be how much were exposed to but when were exposed to it an adult who has fully developed is likely less sensitive to the effects of phthalates than a fetus or an infant whose development can be fundamentally changed by hormonal disruptions\\n\\nthe united states environmental protection agency epa already sets a much lower threshold for the level of phthalates an infant should consume—just 02 milligrams a day per kilogram of body weight if your average fourmonthold infant scarfed down an entire box of the powdered stuff he or she could indeed exceed that limit but if your fourmonthold has jumped right from their first taste of solid food to consuming an entire box of macncheese a day you probably have other concerns your typical twoyearold—a demographic with more cause for concern—would have to eat five boxes to exceed the epas safe dosage toddlers may love their powdered cheese but are they regularly eating thousands of calories worth in a single day again were concerned and its not because of your tykes phthalate exposure\\n\\nthe real issue is that these chemicals are ubiquitous so macncheese is likely not your only source of exposure if you wear perfume wash your clothes with detergents containing fragrance breathe while inside a room with vinyl floors eat a container of jelly or chow down on a carton of vegan ice cream you’re probably getting some phthalates toojust how much these daily activities contribute to your exposure is really hard to tell which is why epa estimates have found that everyone from infants to adolescents routinely bypass their recommended threshold how can we not given that phthalates have been found in spices seafood fruit juice and beer the macncheese report did not test for the presence of phthalates in the macaroni but its likely that they too would have tested positive—phthalates have been found in bread and cereal products as well even if you buy products in glass jars youre likely getting exposed when you consume them one study found that glass jars of olives and peanut butter contain phthalates—they migrate from the little plastic gaskets that keep those jars sealed\\n\\nthe big takeaway its easy to obsess over the things we feel we can control you can always choose to cut macncheese out of your childs diet and that decision may make you feel like youre protecting them from toxic chemical exposure its the same reason we rejoice over studies that seem to say coffee helps us live longer or that chili peppers are the latest superfood—we want to believe that we can make choices that are good for us but the truth is that our food system—and other industries—make it basically impossible to avoid the chemicals used to malign your toddlers favorite food so the unsatisfying conclusion as always is this you should probably enjoy

ham slices and sausage\\n\\nafter ruling out other possible causes for his vision loss the teen was diagnosed with nutritional optic neuropathy or damage to the optic nerve that results from nutritional deficiencies the condition can be caused by drugs malabsorption of food poor diet or alcohol abuse purely dietary causes are rare in developed countries the authors said\\n\\nits known that the b vitamins are essential for many cellular reactions and deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to the buildup of toxic byproducts of metabolism and eventually to the damage of nerve cells according to the university of iowa\\n\\nvision loss from nutritional optic neuropathy is potentially reversible if caught early however by the time the teen was diagnosed his vision loss was permanent whats more wearing glasses would not help the teens vision because damage to the optic nerve cannot be corrected with lenses said study lead author dr denize atan a consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at bristol medical school and bristol eye hospital \\n\\nthe teen was prescribed nutritional supplements which prevented his vision loss from getting any worse\\n\\nthe teen was also referred to mental health services for an eating disorder the researchers note that the teens diet was more than just picky eating because it was very restrictive and caused multiple nutritional deficiencies \\n\\na relatively new diagnosis known as avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder previously known as selective eating disorder involves a lack of interest in food or avoidance of foods with certain textures colors etc without concern to body weight or shape the condition usually starts in childhood and patients often have a normal body mass index bmi as was the case for this patient the authors saidwhile theres no question that food allergies are real — and for some potentially lifethreatening — people who selfdiagnose as food allergic without consulting a medical professional may be misinterpreting their symptoms as an allergic reaction the study authors wrote\\n\\nin those cases what the individuals were experiencing could be a sign of food intolerance or other food related conditions rather than a true allergic response lead study author dr ruchi gupta a pediatrician and professor of pediatrics at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in illinois said in a statement\\n\\nallergic reactions are the immune systems response to a trigger that is perceived as a threat regarding food allergies when some people eat a certain type of food — such as nuts shellfish wheat or dairy — it broadcasts an alarm signal to their immune system provoking reactions that can vary widely between individuals according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc\\n\\nsymptoms of food allergies can include hives itching and swelling in the nose and throat and stomach pain or nausea in extreme cases food allergies may lead to anaphylaxis — a state of shock accompanied by low blood pressure and constricted airways — which can be fatal if untreated according to the mayo clinic\\n\\nshellfish is the most common food allergen in the us affecting approximately 7 million adults according to the study milk allergies affect nearly 5 million people followed closely by peanut allergies which affect about 5 million people other widespread allergens include tree nuts fish eggs wheat soy and sesame the scientists reported\\n\\nallergies can be inherited or acquired sometimes unexpectedly — bites from a type of tick have been linked to the onset of an allergy to meat and a woman who recently received a lung transplant also acquired her organ donors peanut allergy\\n\\nin fact developing food allergies in adulthood happens more frequently than expected the scientists reported they learned from the surveys that about 48 percent of the subjects who had food allergies first experienced at least one of them as an adult\\n\\nwe were surprised to find that adultonset food allergies were so common gupta said\\n\\nif a person suspects that they have a food allergy it is critical that they visit a doctor for testing and diagnosis before attempting to correct the problem by eliminating foods from their diet gupta said in the statement\\n\\nif food allergy is confirmed understanding the management is also critical including recognizing symptoms of anaphylaxis and how and when to use epinephrine he addedlab meat also known as in vitro meat or clean meat is grown from just a few stem cells taken from a living animal the first labgrown meat was consumed in 2013 at a news conference in london it was a burger made by mark post a pharmacologist at maastricht university in the netherlands and the two tasters reported that it was a bit dry\\n\\nin general people are kind of grossed out about any sort of meat grown in the lab researchers have found a survey of potential labmeat customers in the united states published last year in the journal plos one found that twothirds of people would be willing to try the stuff but only onethird could see themselves eating it regularly\\n\\non average people see clean meat as more ethical and environmental than farmed meat but less natural tasty and appealing said study coauthor matti wilks a doctoral student in psychology at the university of queensland australia \\n\\nonly 16 percent of respondents to wilks survey said theyd eat labgrown meat if it were more expensive than typical meat suggesting that people generally dont put too much monetary value on the ethical and environmental benefits of the product\\n\\nthat study found a very small number of people who reported that theyd be more willing to eat meat from animals like dogs horses and cats if that meat were grown in the lab but the numbers were so small they wouldnt be noticeable if scaled up to the whole population of consumers wilks told live science whats more she noted the study found that vegetarians who already didnt eat meat were among the least likely to say theyd start eating meat if it were labgrown similarly people who dont see the appeal of cannibalism arent likely to change their minds just because the meat was never part of a living person she said\\n\\ni cant imagine that people who dont want to eat human meat now would suddenly feel motivated to eat human meat when produced via cellular agriculture wilks said 7 ways food needs to changemagnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body after calcium potassium and sodium the researchers said the element activates hundreds of enzymes that are involved in important biological reactions including the enzymes that play a role in vitamin d metabolism the review said\\n\\nbut many people dont get enough magnesium — a national survey from 20052006 found that about half of all americans didnt consume enough magnesium the review said according to the national institutes of health nih the recommended amount of magnesium is 400420 milligrams per day for men and 310320 mg a day for women\\n\\nprevious research has suggested that consuming magnesium can reduce the risk of vitamin d deficiency a 2013 study found that people who consumed relatively high levels of magnesium were less likely to have low vitamin d levels compared with people who didnt get enough magnesium\\n\\nit may be that people who get enough magnesium require less vitamin d supplementation to reach adequate vitamin d levels than they would if they didnt get enough magnesium razzaque said by consuming an optimal amount of magnesium one may be able to lower the risks of vitamin d deficiency he said\\n\\nsome studies have also found that people with higher magnesium intakes have higher bone mineral density and a lower risk of osteoporosis compared with people with lower intakes of magnesium the researchers said however more research is needed to see whether taking magnesium supplements can prevent or treat osteoporosis according to the nih\\n\\nfoods high in magnesium include almonds bananas beans broccoli brown rice cashews egg yolk fish oil flaxseed green vegetables milk mushrooms other nuts oatmeal pumpkin seeds sesame seeds soybeans sunflower seeds sweet corn tofu and whole grains according to the review\\n\\nits important to note that if people take magnesium supplements they should not consume more than the recommended amount which is 350 milligrams per day for adults this limit is for supplements only it may be lower than the recommended daily amount because the latter includes magnesium from food as well as supplements too much magnesium from dietary supplements can cause diarrhea nausea and abdominal cramping and extremely high intakes can lead to irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest according to the nih    \\n       1           cup  almonds  unblanched\\n       1           cup  white flour  unsifted\\n     12           cup  wholewheat flour\\n     12

againsaturated fats are found in few vegetable oils palm oil and palm kernel oil are two you’ll see listed in packaged foods but they are found in many spreads and condiments including butter lard cream cheese shortening and cream or cheesebased salad dressings as well as the skin on poultry and in certain cuts of meat while saturated fats have been thought in the past to contribute to heart disease as well as inflammation that can make other conditions worse recent information has made this issue less clear cut so although the jury is still out on whether saturated fats are really as bad as they were previously made out to be it’s important to not go “butter crazy” and still practice moderation until more research is done\\n\\ntrans fats are far and away the worst type of fat although meats and dairy products contain trace amounts of naturallyoccurring trans fat the large majority of trans fats in the us diet are manmade these manmade trans fats are produced by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils and used in some baked goods and deepfryer oils to extend shelf life trans fats raise your bad ldl cholesterol and lower your good hdl cholesterol so they increase your risk of heart disease even more than saturated fats they also raise your risk of type 2 diabetes and increase inflammation which can worsen arthritis pain stick margarine typically contains trans fats and should therefore be avoided however many brands of soft tub margarine are now transfat free to identify healthy spreads make sure the label specifies 0 g trans fat and the ingredients panel does not list any hydrogenated oils\\n\\nother spreads include sterol and stanol spreads sterols and stanols are natural substances found in small amounts in the cell membranes of certain plants sterols and stanols have a structure similar to cholesterol these compounds compete with cholesterol for access to receptors in the digestive tract effectively blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol and ultimately leading to lower blood cholesterol levels because you can’t get therapeutic doses from food alone manufacturers have added concentrated amounts of sterols and stanols to certain hearthealthy spreads that taste and cook just like margarine these spreads should be used only by people with cholesterol problems who should consume no more than the recommended amount two to three tablespoons per day i suggest trying the light versions of these spreads to save caloriesfruits and vegetables are “juicy foods” that consist mostly of water but they also provide a variety of vitamins minerals phytonutrients and a good amount of fiber that helps fill you up juice is another story when whole produce is processed into juice most of the fiber is lost and you’re left with a less nutritious end product and consider this it takes a couple minutes to eat a 60calorie orange but only a couple seconds to guzzle down a 110calorie glass of oj\\n\\nfruit juice in particular is a highly concentrated source of fruit sugar this can raise your blood sugar quickly and that’s why juice is not recommended for people with type 2 diabetes individuals with high triglycerides should avoid fruit juice as well as its concentrated simple sugars can raise triglyceride levels even higher fruit drinks — not to be confused with 100 percent juices — are an even worse choice because they contain added sugars and less nutrition because both fruit juices and fruit drinks are caloriedense and low in fiber people trying to lose or manage weight should dramatically limit their intake and choose fresh filling whole fruit instead\\n\\nvegetables are naturally lower in sugar than fruit which means freshly made vegetable juice is lower in calories than fruit juice and can be a helpful way to “squeeze” more produce into your diet however bottled and canned vegetable and tomato juices are not generally recommended as they contain high amounts of sodium which increases your risk of hypertension\\n\\nwhile it’s better to get your nutrients and fiber from whole vegetable and fruit sources juice does still contain vitamins and minerals for example certain juices are high in vitamin c and contain folate and minerals such as potassium some juices like orange juice may also be fortified with calcium if you are going to drink juice look for 100 percent juice that doesn’t have any added sugar or sodium you can also make your own fresh squeezed or pressed juices at home and you may want to consider diluting your beverage with water or caloriefree seltzer to cut calories and sugarthe vitamin c in some juices is largely responsible for the health of collagen a protein that helps maintain healthy skin and cartilage eating and drinking vitamin c–rich fruits and vegetables will help replenish your skin’s vitamin c stores and enhance its natural beauty vitamin c also aids in joint flexibility and maintenance of healthy hair lastly vitamin c may help prevent cataracts and macular degeneration\\n\\nsome juices are fortified with the mineral calcium which helps keep your bones healthy juices that contain calcium may be able to help lower blood pressure reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and prevent osteoporosis calcium may also help alleviate pms cramping juices rich in potassium may further help prevent osteoporosis by forming osteocalcin a protein found only in the bone drinking potassiumrich juice can also help keep blood pressure low\\n\\nb vitamins like folate may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease slow agerelated memory decline and help maintain healthy hair folate also contributes to the production of serotonin so it may help ward off depression and improve mood\\n\\naside from being a potential weightloss buster certain varieties of juice mainly citrus juices can trigger migraines in people who are sensitive ibs sufferers take note some people with ibs are sensitive to sources of concentrated sugar like fruit juice and experience discomfort after eating themcompared with diets high in refined grains diets rich in nutritious whole grains reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure on the flip side the diet high in refined grains can contribute to high triglycerides and increase inflammation throughout the body which may worsen symptoms of arthritis refined grains may also stand in the way of weight loss because they are low in fiber they’re not as filling as whole grains and are much easier to overeat\\n\\nwhite bread regular pasta and other products made with “enriched wheat flour” or “allpurpose flour” are wheatbased and therefore contain gluten so they should be avoided by people with celiac disease in fact all versions including healthy wholegrain varieties of wheat rye and barley contain gluten and must be avoided by people with celiac if you have celiac disease specifically choose glutenfree whole grains like wild and brown rice quinoa amaranth buckwheat and whole corn and packaged foods made with these ingredients and as an extra measure of precaution be sure to check package labelsstarchy vegetables are highquality carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins minerals and fiber unlike poorquality carbs such as white bread regular pasta and other refinedgrain products starchy vegetables like sweet and white potatoes winter squash peas and corn offer ample nutrition and are a great addition to your diet when prepared in a healthy way that said starchy vegetables are higher in calories than nonstarchy vegetables like leafy greens green beans broccoli cauliflower peppers cucumbers carrots mushrooms and celery so it’s important to moderate your portions especially if you’re trying to lose weight because of their high starch content starchy vegetables raise bloodsugar levels more than nonstarchy types so individuals with diabetes need to be especially careful about limiting their intake\\n\\nstarchy vegetables are a good source of fiber a highfiber diet aids in weight loss and weight management since fiber fills you up quickly and staves off hunger moderate portions of starchy vegetables at meals such as half a baked potato or half a cup of corn peas or winter squash are a nutritious addition to any weightloss plan eating a diet rich in fiber can also help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and strokecaffeine is a natural chemical that activates the central nervous system which means that it revs up nerves and thought processes regular caffeine consumption from coffee andor tea has been shown to increase shortterm focus and alertness as well as longterm memory although most people enjoy caffeine’s “revved up” effect some people are caffeinesensitive and are left feeling jittery or ill after ingesting a dose if you fall into the second group you’ll want to eliminate caffeinated beverages or adjust your intake to match your personal tolerance those with sleeping problems or insomnia may need to stop drinking caffeinated beverages up to eight hours before bedtime or omit entirely\\n\\nadditionally caffeinated beverages can sometimes trigger migraine headaches in people who are sensitive and ibs sufferers take note some people with ibs become symptomatic after ingesting caffeinated coffee or tea\\n\\ncaffeine may also have some adverse effects on women just before their menstrual cycles some research suggests that the effects of caffeine become magnified for women when they are premenstrual caffeine may exacerbate pms symptoms and cause greater breast tenderness nervousness and irritability if this is true for you switch to herbal teas or decaffeinated beverages at this time in your cyclechocolate contains powerful antioxidants called flavonoids as well as some magnesium these nutrients may help lower blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke\\n\\ndark chocolate is the most nutritious form of chocolate compared with milk chocolate it contains more than double the amount of hearthealthy flavonoids milk chocolate has another strike against it the added milk it contains may reduce the body’s ability to absorb the beneficial flavonoids to enjoy the delicious taste of chocolate and receive the benefits of flavonoids choose a darkchocolate variety that contains at least 70 percent cacao or cocoa\\n\\ndark chocolate’s potential health benefits certainly don’t give you a free pass to overindulge though you’ll still need to watch your portions that’s because even dark chocolate contains calories fat and sugar that will lead to weight gain if you overdo it so be strategic about incorporating this treat into your diet the best darkchocolate varieties contain only one type of fat — cocoa butter — and do not contain added palm oil coconut oil or milk fat technically they’re all saturated fats but cocoa butter has a neutral effect on cholesterol levels so it won’t raise your blood cholesterol the way other saturated fats will\\n\\ntry sticking with oneounce snacksized portions and be sure to account for an extra 150 calories in your daily calorie allotment you may also enjoy a cup of lowfat hot cocoa typically less than 100 calories per cup or a cup of soy milk with one tablespoon of chocolate syrup or powder these beverages are rich in calcium and can help maintain strong bones unsweetened cocoa powder can be used as a flavoring in lowercalorie dessert recipes as well i often include it as an ingredient in my recipes like chocolatehazelnut biscotti chocolate angel food cake and warm dark chocolate sauce with fresh fruit unsweetened cocoa powder is also a glutenfree food so if you have celiac disease it’s perfectly safe to usecheese is a great source of protein and calcium since protein curbs hunger and keeps you feeling satisfied after meals and snacks cheese can help you to lose weight as part of a wellrounded nutrition plan the protein in cheese can slow down the absorption of carbohydrates eaten at the same meal or snack and therefore help balance your bloodsugar levels and improve mood as well\\n\\nthe calcium in cheese can help keep your teeth and bones strong and guard against osteoporosis in women it can also offer some relief from pms symptoms cheese contains additional nutrients like zinc and biotin zinc has several functions in the body it aids in tissue growth and repair prevents and treats macular degeneration protects your skin and helps keep your nails strong both zinc and biotin are also important for hair health\\n\\nthe problem with cheese is that it’s often high in saturated fat which in excess can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease high cholesterol arthritis and memory loss it can also derail your weightloss efforts since fullfat cheese is higher in calories as well as saturated fat look for cheeses that are reducedfat and fatfree to take advantage of the nutritional benefits of cheese without any of these disadvantages and watch out for sodium too cheese can contain a lot of sodium which is especially problematic if you’re concerned about your blood pressure read the labels and seek out cheeses that are low in sodium\\n\\nthe dairy in cheese makes it a trigger for some ibs sufferers aged cheeses are also common triggers for those who suffer from migraines people with celiac disease must check all cheese labels carefully as some cheeses — including all blue cheeses — are made with bread moldfish and shellfish are both great sources of lean protein protein helps fill you up and keep you feeling satisfied which in turn aids your weightloss goals by making you less likely to snack on highcalorie fallback foods between meals protein also helps keep bloodsugar levels steady which improves mood and protects against type 2 diabetes\\n\\nsome fish and shellfish are high in vitamins and minerals like selenium vitamin b12 niacin iron and zinc the selenium in seafood is an antioxidant that can help manage arthritis and maintain healthy skin while vitamin b12 may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and slow memory decline niacin is a b vitamin that may aid in cataract prevention ironrich clams oysters and shrimp can help maintain healthy hair the zinc in oysters and crab can also contribute to healthy hair and beautiful skin while reducing the risk of macular degeneration\\n\\nsome shellfish are high in dietary cholesterol and therefore should be eaten in moderation by individuals with elevated ldlcholesterol levels if you have high cholesterol speak with your physician about how much you should be eating\\n\\nfish that is cured smoked canned or pickled is typically high in sodium and should be avoided by people with high blood pressure and if you suffer from migraines be aware that these same fish varieties which include anchovies caviar lox pickled herring and sardines are also potential migraine triggers\\n\\n as a general rule you should aim to eat at least five servings of vegetables daily that’s about 2 12 cups of cooked vegetables and that includes leafy greens as long as they’re prepared in a healthy way leafy greens like other nonstarchy vegetables are a great addition to your diet and offer countless health benefits\\n\\nleafy greens are full of vitamins minerals and diseasefighting phytochemicals they are rich in fiber an important nutrient for weight loss and maintenance because it keeps you feeling full and helps control your hunger fiber can also lower cholesterol and blood pressure and help to temper bloodsugar swings by slowing the absorption of carbohydrates into your bloodstream after meals this lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes leafy greens also contain a lot of water which helps keep you hydrated and contributes to beautiful skin and hair\\n\\nsome leafy greens like collards and kale are particularly rich in calcium which helps keep your teeth and bones strong and reduces your overall risk for osteoporosis calcium also contributes to muscle function and bloodpressure management leafy greens contain potassium as well which further protects against osteoporosis and helps manage bloodpressure levels\\n\\nthe antioxidants like vitamin c lutein and zeaxanthin that are contained in leafy greens may help reduce your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration vitamin c helps the body make collagen too collagen is a major component of cartilage that aids in joint flexibility may reduce your risk of arthritis and keeps your skin and hair healthy and

my own\\nwhat is graphic design\\nas we mentioned in one of our previous articles about the issue graphic design can be described as the sphere of human activity that lies on the crossroads of several directions first of all visual arts communication and psychology basically graphic designers do the job of communication to others by means of graphic visual elements such as images of different styles and complexity types and fonts pictograms shapes and sizes colors and shades lines and curves etc graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception transfer the message so he makes them functional therefore we could say that graphic designers are artists applying their talents mostly not in pure art but communicating and purposeful art\\n\\nmodern graphic design broadly covers all spheres of human life which deal with visual communication from books and posters to sophisticated mobile applications or 3d animation let’s look into directions in which graphic designers can express their creativity for the sake of solving problems and satisfying needs\\ngraphic design directions\\nnowadays graphic design is an incredibly broad sphere for the application of artistic talents in particular it includes\\n\\neditorial design\\nillustration\\nidentity logo and branding design\\nicons and pictograms\\ntypography\\ninterface graphics and elements\\nprint advertisements\\nbig print items such as posters and billboards\\nsigns\\npackaging etc\\nthus it’s easily seen that modern designers in this sphere have multiple options to apply their talents in all the mentioned directions the basic purpose of graphic design is to serve a particular purpose or even a set of them by means and techniques of artcontact signaware corp\\n original memo \\nbcc

life of fight fight against the ugliness just like a doctor fights against disease for us the visual disease is what we have around and what we try to do is cure it somehow with design” remembering the words we have to say that the purposes of modern graphic design are pushed further and further not only does it beautify the physical or digital object but also helps its users navigates them guides their way via which they can get both aesthetic pleasure and problemsolving benefits\\n\\ngraphic design purposes\\ntoday graphic design can set diverse purposes it rarely happens that the object of graphic design serves only one objective looking over the most essential of them we would mention the following\\n\\nidentifying\\nthis purpose first of all serves for branding reasons it is primarily concerned about creating logos which usually lies the foundation for the whole branding strategy this is the task at which designers work with multiple factors combining specific features of the target audience laws and rules of artistic harmony the psychology of color and shape impact on human perception and emotions the current situation on the market business goals of the brand or company\\n\\nnumerous logos accomplished by studio designers have proved that this symbolic image plays the crucial role in all the next stages of brand strategy including print work like posters business cards corporate documentation templates etc interface design when brand or company uses digital sources and channels of reaching their clients like blogs websites apps widgets etc branded items like stationery cups notebooks etc and other directions the efficient logo is usually based on deep analysis supported by designer’s talent and skills and presents a balanced mixture of art and functionality thinking over all the details the designer selects the type and image of a logo that will correspond to the objectives of the company or brand strategyhi all\\ni have this program in

understand what this statement is supposed to mean\\nabout changing individual colors in 8bitquantizedrasterized image\\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may\\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image\\nwhat are you saying\\nxv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the\\nmentioned type images\\nah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8\\nbit previews of 24 bit images then i point out problems with this now you are\\nsaying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those\\nparts of the program that cause the problem\\nmoreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global\\nchanges \\nnot sure what you are

24bit image modified because user dont see full 24bit\\nimage theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to\\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if\\nimage is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 7x7\\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area \\nselecting individual color is possible from that\\nyes that is one

who\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image

a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the

click pictures everywhere with not only professional cameras but also with smartphone cameras who does not want to look beautiful everyone wants to look gorgeous or want the images they click to look beautiful pictures straight out of the camera may look okay or even more than okay with expensive cameras but they are not perfect at all\\n\\nto make images perfect image editing or postprocessing is necessary graphic designers or photoshop experts have professional knowledge of image editing software like adobe photoshop cc lightroom illustration etc most of the photographers also learn photoshop to edit their image on their own but this slows down the productivity of the photographer so today’s article is not only for the editors and designers but also for the photographers who can speed up their editing process with this basic editing\\n\\nimage editing tips for graphic designers and photographers\\nthe 5 image editing tips i am going to talk about today is for speeding up the editing process so that you can focus on the more important and critical things of course if you are a graphic designer or a photoshop expert the most important thing for you is editing but if you are a photographer then clicking pictures is more important than editing\\n\\nthe photo editing tips i am going to share is a combination of a few basic editing and easing the workflow for you so let’s get started without any delay…straighten and crop\\nafter you insert your image into an image editing software the first thing you should do is to ensure your image is straight enough framing is an important aspect of making images look from good to great to hit the right spot with image framing you should have to have the knowledge about photography and framing i can give you what i know but let’s keep that for another day\\nso the first thing is to straighten your image and this can be done by cropping your image use the cropping tool of your image editing software and use a grid view while you crop why grid view is important well the whole photography or cinematography is standing upon one rule that is the “rule of thirds” to be able to put your image one the rule of thirds you have to use the grid view so use grid view and crop tool then crop your image straighten it put it in the rule of thirds\\n\\nremove dust particles\\nthe next mustdo thing in your image editing is fixing the image the process that we use to remove dust spots blemishes and wrinkles from a photo is the photo retouching service in this image editing technique we use the healing brush tool patch tool red eye clone tool eraser tool blur tool dodge and burn tools to fix the imperfection of the image\\n\\nduring the photoshoot a photographer tries as hard as possible to get the perfect click but the raw image from the camera may contain dust particles or maybe something came into the background these are unavoidable and uncontrollable circumstances so what should we do if we face something like this the answer is image postprocessing in photoshop\\n\\nif you get minor spots scratches or blemishes image retouching technique can save you on the other hand if you unwanted subject appearing in your frame then the background removal process will help you in background removal service all you need to do is use the clipping path technique to select the object you want to remove and then hit the delete button\\nadjust the highlights and shadows\\nhighlights and shadows are an important aspect of an image and if you messed up here your image will look awful generally the photographer tries hard to keep the highlights and shadows close to perfect during the shoot so try to achieve the maximum balance of highlights and shadow in the raw image and then make it perfect in postprocessingin

to manipulate your image and make with your imagination then you should only care for the lighting and shadow because in the image manipulation technique you can manipulate almost everything around the subject without the lighting and shadow yes you can edit them also but won’t get the jawdropping result if you overdo it\\n\\nuse presets\\nthe editing tips i have given above are the basic thing you should do when you go to postprocess your image now let’s talk about overall editing and applying different filters after you complete those basic editing tries to use presets or actions to edit your image what is preset or what are photoshop actions\\n\\nwell these are a combination of image editing that is saved and you can use them on a similar kind of image to get similar output but faster than before how to use presets it’s easy to just insert your image and do some basic touch up and then got to the preset menu and selects the saved preset in your computer and hit apply your image will get a similar filter that the preset holds by using presets and actions you can achieve faster workflow like never before\\n\\nuse batchediting\\nsometimes you have lots of images that need similar kinds of editing editing then one by one is a timewasting job for sure in lightroom you can do batch editing basically it is a process by which editors use a preset and select all the images

graphic design\\nwe have prepared a selection of key trends in graphic design for 2020 from the article you will learn what will be at the peak of the wave and what goes into the past so what will be the graphic design tomorrow\\n\\ntemplates and textures\\ntoday there is a noticeable increase in the use of templates and textures but there is no need to use them like competitors the trend for 2020 is to combine several patterns in one design in several parts\\n\\nvirtual network users are faced with a deficit of texture and volumetric images for this reason the full immersion format is becoming increasingly popular\\n\\ngraphic design has picked up trends in recent years the triumph of gradients is replaced by the triumphant return of realistic textures contours and graininess make you want to touch what you see for this reason you need to find a really good developer to convert psd to html this allows us to speak about the future of this trend especially in the field of graphic design  \\n\\ncolour solution 2020\\nspecialists from the pantone color institute proposed to call the main color of 2020 – a shade of blue it is listed under the number 194052 its other name is “classicblue”\\naccording to representatives of pantone this shade can be described as “an encouraging presence that can cause confidence calmness this blue color will be associated with stability constancy which is lacking in the modern world people are always in a hurry tired of the excess of information received they lack trusting communication honesty the classic blue color will help to calm down to gather thoughts\\n\\nspecialists of the color institute decided to make a real gift for people they wanted consumers not only to learn about the main shade of the year but also to experience multisensory experience which will be associated with the classic blue color thematic images with soundtracks were created thematic aroma and special fabric were invented cooperation with representatives of world companies allowed inventing even a tea mixture as well as multimedia installation in honor of the main color of the year\\n\\nit is important to mention that the institute of color has been selecting the main shade of the year for 20 years experts’ predictions are based on the analysis of many social trends that can have an impact on different industries including design and fashion  \\n\\nisometry\\nthe creation of threedimensional objects in twodimensional measurement is a trend that has been actively developed this year designers can touch the miracle of making an entire universe in a small space it will take some time to explore all the details of this universe\\n\\nin article 734553308snxrjckuucp robrjckuucp robert jc kyanko writes\\ngchenessexecnuoknoredu

in the wrong numbers on your\\ncalculator  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is\\n307200 which is 300k to be exact  640x400x256 only takes 250k but i\\ndont think it is a bios mode

studio proofing tool for designers and creative teams\\npublished in graphic design software tools\\namong all of the design agencies’ headaches artwork proofing is probably one of the most acute ones forwarding countless numbers of requests following up your approvers with reminders that they have a file to check searching for their feedback in the endless pile of emails or messages… quite daunting to say the least and quite expensive too – the amounts of time and as a result money spent on this backandforth game are quite significant however there is a solution that would allow you to cut your turnaround time by up to 35 – a specialized proofing software\\n\\none of such programs is approval studio it is a proofing tool developed specifically to help designers and creative teams spend less time on boring and repetitive processes and make the whole workflow more organized and efficient there are quite a few features with which approval studio helps you to streamline proofing of visual assets so let’s create a project upload some file and see what we can do with it\\n\\n№1 sharing files\\nafter the upload users can start sharing their artwork with other reviewers there are two types of reviewers internal – they can access your dashboard or even get tasks assigned to them in approval’s pro version – and external ones let’s concentrate on the latter\\na big blue “share” button in the upper right corner is the starting point of your cooperation with the clients you can send the invitation to approval studio to their email or share a short link via your messenger chat – with a password or making the file readonly if you like your reviewer will be able to see the same thing you see and add annotations \\n\\n№2 online review tool\\napproval studio offers advanced annotation possibilities that include a set of different shapes namely a point a circle a square and a freeform if you need to draw something by hand users can pick a color for each annotation which is helpful when there are several reviewers also there is a possibility to bind one annotation to several places in the artwork if there is the same repeated mistake or if you need to apply similar changes let’s say to the fonts or colors annotations will appear on the mockup itself and on the comments panel to the right\\nif you need to check the artwork from another angle or annotate a much smaller detail it is not a problem at all approval studio allows rotating the image as much as you like and zooms it without descaling or quality loss so that you can read even the tiniest text\\n\\nthe main thing is that the system is totally live – whenever they add a comment you will see it instantly on your screen with no need to refresh the page it works like a builtin messenger to make your review sessions more convenient\\n\\nafter the discussion is over the last thing that’s left is approving or rejecting the file at this stage it’s important to be careful because you will not be able to add any new annotations to this version after you confirm your verdicttoronto siggraph \\nwhat chances art 2d graphics and animation on the indigo\\nby    ken evans imagicians artware

perfect printed sticker\\npublished in graphic design\\nmeasure after all an incredible design can become a costly waste if the print is lowquality\\n\\nas well as all the design elements mentioned in this article you should know exactly what your stickers will be used for before starting once you have a clear vision a professional designer and a copywriter can bring your ideas together to create a sticker that’s visually appealing and persuasive\\n\\ndesigning the perfect sticker\\nsticker design is as much science as it is art there are four key elements to the design stage shape size typography and colour the way you use creativity within these parameters is what determines how well your sticker or label is perceived don’t be afraid to break some rules to make your sticker stand out\\n\\nshape\\nthe shape of your sticker depends on the purpose of your sticker is it for marketing or is it going to be a product label if it’s just for giving away to customers size isn’t as important as it would be for a product label\\n\\nthere are many creative shapes and sizes for stickers and product labels the latter requires precise measurements to ensure it’s right for the product package you might want your product label to complement the shape of the packaging like the label on marmite…wing the suggestion of stu lynne i have posted the image file format executable and source

people are using idl with a package called sips this was\\n  developed at the university of colorado boulder by some people working\\n  for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl\\n  or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i\\n  expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general\\n  purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has\\n  sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose\\n  it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i\\n  have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive\\n  used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best\\n  speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large\\n  images take quite a while 5070 times as long to process  thats a\\n  freebie if you want it\\n  my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems\\n  inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it\\n  handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing\\n  the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even\\n  excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih\\n  image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use\\n  compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement\\n  cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line which i might do like in

utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci\\n  database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape\\n  formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file\\n  this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can\\n  display data from the pci database to one or another of several\\n  pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype\\n  dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and\\n  fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg\\n  multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and\\n  god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont\\n  use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your\\n  particular applicationinterest calls for\\n  each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from\\n  a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default\\n  directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci\\n  data structures database file parameter file\\n  the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the\\n  macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different\\n  interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphicarts industrys ct2t format would probably i havent tried\\n  handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what\\n  youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start\\n  over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to\\n  contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of\\n  other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude\\n  longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this\\n  can go into the pci database\\n  i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax\\n  systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific\\n  thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to\\n  mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus\\n  24bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill\\n  in your case it seems designed for the very high end\\n  applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice\\n  although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its\\n  probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which\\n  does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe\\n  the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these\\n  areas\\nspam spectral analysis manager\\n  back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam spectral

of graphic design with this video from gcflearnfree\\n\\ngraphic design – molding users’ experience visually\\ngraphic design is an ancient craft dating back past egyptian hieroglyphs to 17000yearold cave paintings as a term originating in the 1920s’ print industry and covering a range of activities including logo creation it concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing – attracting viewers using images color and typography however graphic designers working in user experience ux design must justify stylistic choices regarding say image locations and font with a humancentered approach focusing on—and seeking maximum empathy with—users while creating goodlooking designs that maximize usability aesthetics must serve a purpose – in ux design we don’t create art for art’s sake so when doing graphic design for ux you should consider the information architecture of your interactive designs to ensure accessibility for users and leverage graphic design skills in creating output that considers the entire user experience including users’ visual processing abilities for instance if an otherwise pleasing mobile app can’t offer users what they need in several thumbclicks its designers will have failed to marry graphic design to user experience the scope of graphic design in ux covers creating beautiful designs that users find highly pleasurable meaningful and usable\\n\\n“design is

how elements match the tone eg sansserif fonts for excitementhappiness and overall effect noting how you shape users’ emotions as you guide them from say a landing page to a call to action often graphic designers are involved in motion design for smaller screens carefully monitoring how the work’s aesthetics match users’ expectations and enhance usability in a flowing seamless experience by anticipating their needs and mindsets with user psychology in mind some especially weighty graphic design considerations are\\n\\nsymmetry and balance including symmetry

switch\\ndesigners are in love with procreate the app built for creative professionals makes designing on an ipad easier and more efficient in a completely new way but can a 999 app be a realistic photoshop competitor\\n\\nfor some the answer is a definite yes\\n\\nhere are five reasons procreate could become your goto design app and five reasons why it might not plus an introduction to what procreate is and why it might be the perfect app for you\\n\\nwhat is procreate\\nif you aren’t familiar with procreate it’s an ipad app that’s made for professional creatives you can sketch paint and edit with a robust collection of tools it responds to touch and pressure with the apple pencil for detailed work\\n\\nthe tool includes a sleek interface and is a game changer when it comes to online drawing apps it includes 64bit color customizable brushes incredible canvas resolutions a nice layer system and cinemastyle effects\\n\\nplus everything includes the ease of use you’d expect from an apple product and you can save images from device to device while this tool is fun for a lot of creatives it’s most practical applications are for sketching illustrations some light editing and for drawing typography but can procreate replace other software and tools maybe\\n1 quick image tweaking\\nant to touch up an image or stylize a piece of artwork procreate has got you covered the image tweaking – we won’t call this an editing suite – includes blurs sharpening curve manipulation color balance and more think of these tools as giving you the ability to design a cool filter of your own instagram style and apply it to images\\n\\nthen you can make it super fun with a timelapse view of the changes that you can share this small feature is great for designers that are experimenting with new techniques and want to get or give feedback\\n\\nfor editing on a tablet this is probably one of the best and most professional options available\\nwhile tweaking images is fun procreate is really designed for illustrators the brush library has more than 130 brushes that create almost any art technique you can images there’s also a dualtexture system so you can mix and match brush types\\n\\nevery brush is customizable as well you’d be hardpressed to have this many tools in an actual studio and we have a collection of 30 of the best procreate brushes to get you started\\n\\nwhat sets procreate apart in terms of illustration is that this is a professional set of tools you can create a huge canvas to work on and export the drawings in high resolution still or video frames\\n\\nit’s hard to imagine how cool the illustration tools are until you start playing with them add the apple pencil to the mix and it’s just like the real thing… albeit with the ability to tap “undo” the drawing experience is as close to real as you can get in thedominic lai cscylaicsusthk wrote\\n simon crowe scrowehemelbullcouk wrote\\n 8 i require bgi drivers for super vga

graphic design world is going to feel a lot more reserved harmonious and natural \\n\\nwell except for the illustrations those are going to get a lot more abstract this year\\n\\nthis shift is likely a reaction to the overuse of some of the previous graphic design trends \\n\\ndesign styles that were very unique just a few years ago have become just another common tactic used by massive corporations \\n\\nso to stay ahead of the curve be sure to check out the 8 graphic design trends for 2020 and beyond below as soon as he learned about the existence of ancient wheat specimens at university college london’s petrie museum of egyptian archaeology from a 2018 bbc documentary richard mott of the ucl genetics institute wanted to study them the samples likely contained bits of ancient wheat dna he reasoned which could yield valuable insights into the history of cultivation of this allimportant crop species\\n\\narchaeobotanists at ucl helped mott and a team of collaborators choose a handful of wellpreserved husks from the museum’s collection of ancient emmer wheat a variety native to the near east and one of the first crops to be domesticated in the region from which the researchers selected two husks for dna extraction after carefully removing the husks from the box photographing them and wrapping them in foil the scientists transported the centuriesold plant material to a freshly bleached cleanroom used exclusively to process ancient and forensic samples \\nthere team member laura botigué a population geneticist and visiting researcher from the centre for research in agricultural genomics crag in barcelona spain donned a hairnet two tyvek suits two pairs of latex gloves and a mask—part of a protocol designed to avoid contaminating the samples with her own cells uncertain how the delicate husks would hold up to the standard decontamination protocol of bleaching the samples botigué bleached one and left the second untouched then to lyse the plant’s cells she put the samples in a rotator that gently shook the husks inside an oven over the next several days finally she used a centrifugation protocol to separate any dna from the degraded cell walls and proteins\\n\\nonce the samples had been prepped and delivered to the ucl genomics facility for sequencing it was a waiting game to see if the procedure had yielded any readable wheat dna “this is the more stressful part” botigué says because they lack the type of protective collagen matrix found in bones plants don’t preserve ancient dna as well as animals “you finish the dna is theoretically extracted but you don’t see it in the tube” says botigué “you’re in the blind until you hear back from the sequencing services” \\n\\nwithin just a few weeks the team got good news for the husk that botigué had bleached about twothirds of the reads aligned with genomes of modern wild and domesticated emmer wheat varieties—a relatively good success rate for ancient dna according to evolutionary geneticist michael scott a postdoc in mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences “the first surprise was how well it worked” he says “it appears that the dry conditions in egypt were good for dna preservation” the unbleached husk had yielded a smaller quantity of sequences but those fragments mostly matched the ones in the bleached sample validating the identity of those sequences as coming from the ancient wheat samples rather than from contaminants\\n\\nthe museum wheat which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 bc was genetically much more similar to modern domesticated varieties than to modern wild ones suggesting that the plant lineage the samples came from had already been domesticated specifically the sequences most resembled those of modern domesticated strains grown in turkey oman and india there was also evidence for genetic exchange between the museum wheat strain and the wild emmer wheat that grew in the levant a large region in the eastern mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the neolithic period and where emmer was first cultivated the genetic exchange could have occurred before the wheat’s introduction to egypt from the levant says scott alternatively it’s possible that the ancient egyptians’ wheat was able to interbreed with wild wheat in the southern levant thanks to interactions between the people in the two regions \\nthe bioinformatics analysis also uncovered some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied if these variants helped the wheat survive in arid locations around the near east perhaps introducing those sequences into modern varieties could help make them more sustainable or more drought resistant scott says though he admits that this “is very much just an idea” \\n\\nthe detection of ancient genetic variation is a notable achievement because wheat genomes are large—three to five times the length of a human genome—and repetitive making the “analysis    incredibly complex” says james breen head of the bioinformatics core at the south australian health and medical research institute who reviewed the study and coauthored the perspective with rabanuswallace a phd student in his lab at the australian centre for ancient dna at the time “so being able to find unique pieces of dna in that genome is very difficult” he adds that after a couple of additional validation tests performed by the ucl team he was convinced that “the data that came out was legitimately ancient”\\n\\nbotigué and scott emphasize that the study is primarily a proof of concept that museumkept plant samples can yield readable genetic material “we were able to look at dna from specimens that had been stored in the museum for over 90 years without special preservation conditions—the museum was actually even bombed and flooded during wartime” says scott “we think our study helps demonstrate the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data which”—in combination with new samples—“can be used to uncover the history of selection on crops and their movement around the globe” \\n\\nphilippineamerican war\\nduring the spanishamerican war rebels in the philippines proclaimed their independence after 300 years of spanish rule… only to have their

revolutionary assembly that drew up the first democratic constitution in asia—launched a revolt \\n\\nthe united states responded by sending in troops and by war’s end over 4000 american soldiers had

last war of manifest destiny and western expansion and our first imperial land war in asia it was the united states testing out what role it would have on the world stage and bringing with it all the

reports for the guardian archaeologists working in the ancient city have found evidence of a recycling program in which pompeiians piled garbage at the city’s walls and sorted it for reuse in new projects\\n\\nthe researchers led by tulane university archaeologist allison emmerson analyzed soil samples recovered from trash excavated in and around the city the soil on the rubbish varied depending on where it was thrown out cesspits left traces of organic soil while litter dumped in the street or piled up outside of the city’s walls was covered in sandy deposits\\n\\n“the difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled” emmerson—set to detail her research in life and death in the roman suburb out next month from oxford university press—tells the guardian\\n\\nemmerson and her colleagues found signs of the same sandy soil present in garbage mounds inside of several pompeiian buildings’ walls these structures’ cores were made of reused materials ranging from crumbled tiles to amphorae and lumps of mortar and plaster the walls’ outer surfaces were covered in a layer of plaster that hid the “mess of materials” found within according to emmerson\\n\\nthis evidence suggests “the piles outside the walls weren’t material that’s been dumped to get rid of it” the archaeologist tells the guardian “they’re outside the walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside the walls”\\n\\nthe team’s findings refute a previous theory about the garbage piles’ origins per a 2012 press release from the university of cincinnati 19thcentury archaeologists suspected the piles represented rubble cleared out of pompeii after an earthquake rattled the city in 62 ad—17 years before the volcanic eruption that killed some 2000 of the city’s 12000 inhabitants the majority of the mounds were actually removed by archaeologists during the 20th century reports the guardian\\n\\n“as i was working outside pompeii i saw that the city extended into developed neighborhoods outside the walls  so it didn’t make sense to me that these suburbs were also being used as landfills” says emmerson to the guardian\\n\\nemmerson argues that the ancient romans viewed suburban garbage mounds differently than modern humans think of landfills rather than “corralling waste in areas far removed from normal life” she writes in the abstract for a talk titled “another man’s treasure the life and afterlife of pompeii’s waste” these sites “developed in the busiest areas of the suburb which could serve as staging grounds for processes of recycling and reuse”\\n\\nspeaking with the guardian emmerson adds “for the most part we don’t care what happens to our trash as long as it’s taken away what i’ve found in pompeii is an entirely different priority that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling”\\n\\nemmerson’s previous research has shown that residents of pompeii had a much closer relationship with trash than humans today trash littered pompeii’s streets and was even found piled inside of and on top of the city’s tombs nineteenthcentury archaeologists took these mounds as a sign that the 62 ad earthquake made the city fall into disrepair but emmerson then at the university of cincinnati challenged this view by highlighting evidence suggesting the city was in a “period of rejuvenation” by 79 ad\\n\\npompeiians had a different relationship with death and cleanliness than 19thcentury archaeologists thought according to the archaeologist\\n\\n“we tend to assume things like that are universal but attitudes toward sanitation are very culturally defined and it looks like in pompeii attitudes were very different than ours” she told live science’s wynne parry in 2012\\n\\ntombs for example were built not in secluded respectful spaces but in hightraffic parts of the city the goal was to ensure that the deceased would be remembered—a strategy that had the unfortunate side effect of placing people’s resting places directly in the path of the city’s litterleaving inhabitants\\n\\nper the press release emmerson and her colleagues once excavated a room in which two cesspits filled with animal bones olive pits and other assorted waste stood alongside a cistern or tank used for storing drinking and washing water\\n\\n“the pompeiians lived much closer to their garbage than most of us would find acceptable” emmerson tells the guardian “not because the city lacked infrastructure and they didn’t bother to manage trash but because their systems of urban management were organized around different principles”the korean war ‘the forgotten war’\\nthe korean war 19501953 was the first military action of the cold war though it’s often overshadowed by the victory of the allies in world war ii earning it the nickname “the forgotten war” it began when soldiers from the communist north korean people’s army crossed the 38 parallel into the prowestern republic of korea today’s south korea american troops were sent to support the south and by the time a ceasefire was proclaimed in 1953 over five million soldiers and civilians had died to this day a formal peace treaty has not been signed\\n\\nsheila miyoshi jager professor of east asian studies at oberlin and author of brothers at war the unending conflict in korea writes “most histories of the korean war stop with the armistice the fact that no peace treaty was ever signed is presented in most history books as an unusual fact and that is all however the absence of a final conclusion to the korean war has kept it alive as a major influence on asian affairs”the ‘secret war’ in laos\\nlaos is the most heavilybombed country per capita in the world the us bombing of laos 19641973 was part of a clandestine attempt by the cia to wrest power from the pathet lao a communist group allied with north vietnam and the soviet union during the vietnam war laos was critical to dwight d eisenhower’s domino theory of keeping communism at bay and presidents john f kennedy lyndon b johnson and richard nixon all escalated the bombings which largely targeted north vietnamese supply routes along the ho chi minh trail that stretched from vietnam into cambodia and laos\\nwhile the us invasion and bombing of cambodia drew international protests the secret war in laos remains largely shrouded in secrecy even as it marked the beginning of a more militarized cia that would go on to fight proxy wars in latin america and the middle eastcambodian genocide\\nthe cambodian genocide 19751979 led to the deaths of over two million people at the hands of pol pot and the khmer rouge—and was exacerbated by the us bombing and invasion of cambodia vaddey ratner author of in the shadow of the banyan and music of the ghosts and a survivor of the genocide writes “while the khmer rouge genocide is a tragedy perpetrated by cambodians the us aerial bombing campaign created the destruction and chaos that enabled the khmer rouge to seize power that bombing extending for eight years and long kept secret from the american public was in the eyes of american officials a ‘sideshow’ to the war in vietnam”americanindian wars\\nmany elementary school students in the united states are introduced to native americans in the context of the first thanksgiving they don’t reemerge until they become side notes in lesson plans on manifest destiny and the american west—a narrative that often ends at wounded knee in 1890 the term “the americanindian wars” groups multiple conflicts between diverse tribes and settlers spanning nearly three centuries of american history\\n\\ndavid treuer author of the heartbeat of wounded knee writes “rather than a sidebar to american history proper native american history is american history you cant for example understand the american revolution without considering that one of the main reasons for revolt against britain was over the question of whether the colonists or their british masters got to reap the benefit of westward expansion you cant understand the tension between states rights and federal power unless you understand the removal of the 5 civilized tribes from the american southeast in the 1820s and ‘30s and how that paved the way for the expansion of slavery…native people have been since the beginning involved and implicated in the making of america” 7 reasons ulysses s grant was one of america’s most brilliant military leaders\\nin march 1864 ulysses s grant went to washington dc to receive his commission from abraham lincoln as lieutenant general in command of all the union armies after several years of frustration with a parade of unsuitable commanders the president had finally found the man who would defeat robert e lee’s army of northern virginia and thus effectively end the civil war the choice was surprising to many who had known grant in former days ten years before in april 1854 captain grant had submitted his resignation under a cloud\\n\\nin one of history’s unexpected developments the military profession grant “had always disliked” in the words of his biographer bruce catton ultimately “turned out to be the calling made for him” how did an ambivalent soldier who had been away from the army for several years—and who had drifted during that interval from one civilian occupation to another in search of elusive success—end up leading a vast force to victory and saving the union\\n\\ngrant’s predecessors in command of the union army were far more accomplished in military art and science winfield scott whose experience dated back to the war of 1812 had led the army since 1841 george b mcclellan who replaced the aging scott early in the civil war was an able administrator who organized the army of the potomac in the 1850s mcclellan had studied the crimean war at first hand as a member of an official delegation of american observers henry w halleck the author of elements of military art  science was regarded as a master theoretician\\n\\n\\nyet mcclellan and halleck both proved reluctant to take decisive action in the field after the battle of shiloh it took the latter almost a month to advance 20 miles south to attack the vital confederate railroad junction at corinth mississippi lincoln grew so frustrated with mcclellan’s inaction that he responded to the general’s october 1862 request for more horses with an exasperated telegram “i have just read your despatch about sore tongued and fatiegued sic horses will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of antietam that fatigue anything”\\n\\nby contrast grant had never been an enthusiastic student of military art and science even his fiercely loyal lieutenant william t sherman doubted grant’s “knowledge of grand strategy and of books of science and history” he told his friend precisely that in a march 1864 letter in which he also concluded that grant’s triumph owed in large measure to his fundamental “commonsense” and to his “chief characteristic” an unshakeable “faith” in victory that faith was justified by a serendipitous combination of qualities that enabled grant to become one of the most extraordinary military leaders in american history\\ngrant didn’t go in much for doctrine but he brought a relentlessly aggressive approach to warfare he always favored activity and forward movement to standing still even in victory he would be frustrated by subordinates’ failure to pursue the retreating enemy\\nin his memoirs he records an incident that reveals his philosophy in 1863 union general william rosecrans refused an order to advance to meet an enemy force while grant was laying siege to vicksburg the key to controlling the mississippi river because rosecrans claimed that doing so would violate the “military maxim ‘not to fight two decisive battles at the same time’” grant was singularly unimpressed “if true” he observes “the maxim was not applicable in this case it would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day but it would not be bad to win them”\\n\\nwhen in the summer of 1864 grant informed the cautious halleck back in washington of his refusal to disengage lee and withdraw troops to quell draft resistance in the north lincoln responded in language that encapsulated grant’s tenacious approach “i have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold where you are neither am i willing hold on with a bulldog gripe sic and chew  choke as much as possible”\\t\\nhe was fearless\\nsherman told his fellow officer james harrison wilson “i am a damned sight smarter man than grant i know a great deal more about war military history strategy and grand tactics than he does i know more about organization supply and administration and about everything else than he does but i’ll tell you where he beats me and where he beats the world he don’t care a damn for what the enemy does out of his sight but it scares me like hell”\\n\\ngrant’s refusal to be paralyzed by imagining what the enemy was doing owed to an epiphany early in the war when he was leading a regiment for the first time in pursuit of confederate colonel thomas harris in missouri “as we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see harris’ camp and possibly find his men ready formed to meet us my heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat” grant recalls in his memoirs but when he had the good fortune to find the camp abandoned grant’s “heart resumed its place” he learned the vital lesson that his adversary “had been as much afraid of me as i had been of him from that event to the close of the war i never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy though i always felt more or less anxiety”\\nhe brushed off setbacks\\nin april 1862 during the bloody twoday battle of shiloh grant did not share his colleagues’ bleak view sherman was demoralized by the first day’s fighting while don carlos buell who arrived with reinforcements in the midst of the battle advised retreat grant refused “the distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front” he asserts in his memoirs by the next day he continues “we had now become the attacking party the enemy was driven back all day as we had been the day before until finally he beat a precipitate retreat” in may 1864 after fighting to a costly stalemate in his first battle with robert e lee at the wilderness in virginia grant surprised and delighted the union army of the potomac by not retreating as they had done so many times before under different commanders “most of us thought…that the next day we should recross the river” a captain in a massachusetts regiment remembered “but when the order came ‘by the left flank march’ we found that grant was not made that way and we must continue the fight” sherman likewise celebrated grant’s decision “when grant cried ‘forward’ after the battle of the wilderness i said ‘this is the grandest act of his life now i feel that the rebellion will be crushed’ i wrote him saying it was a bold order to give andit showed the mettle of which he was made” \\nhe believed in success—but didn’t romanticize the means to achieving it\\nwhat sherman called grant’s “simple faith in success” proved infectious his confidence and determination made others believe in themselves as well “when you have completed your best preparations you go into battle without hesitationno doubts no reserve” sherman wrote to grant “i tell you that it was this that made us act with confidence i knew wherever i was that you thought of me and if i got in a tight place you would come—if alive”\\n\\nbut grant was no mystic nor was he reckless his confidence was rooted in an unswerving sense of purpose an unflappable nature an ability to delegate responsibility as opposed to micromanaging and knowledge gained by cool and careful observation over the years in the mexican war he studied two commanders in action winfield scott and zachary taylor whose nicknames—“old fuss and feathers” and “old rough and ready”—encapsulate their antithetical styles from taylor who always “put his meaning so plainly there could be no mistaking it” grant learned the importance of clear and direct communication\\n\\nit was in mexico while serving as regimental quartermaster and involving himself in as many battles as he could that grant had learned the decidedly unromantic aspects of war the ingenuity required to feed and supply an army the hazards of poor camp sanitation the value of different kinds of expertise and the unequivocal brutality of combat in the last year of the civil war as casualties mounted and the horrors of trench warfare accumulated in the battles of cold harbor and petersburg grant remained fixed in his purpose to destroy lee’s army \\nhe synthesized information quickly\\nin addition to being a gifted writer grant was an expert listener—“at his best” one staff officer suggested in “sudden emergencies” faced with a new situation as he was on arriving in the besieged city of chattanooga in late 1863 grant sat “as silent as the sphinx” while officers delivered their reports according to an eyewitness then after firing “whole volleys of questions” he proceeded to write out a series of dispatches the biographer william mcfeely explains the significance of this episode grant’s “orders and telegramsdemonstrated a grasp of the whole of the western theater of the war from the disjointed reports he had been given he put together a coherent picture of the terrain of an area new to him and of the vast confused array of men who contended for it”\\n\\nhe had a gift for seeing the lay of the land \\ngrant’s memory for terrain was photographic one staff officer observed that after one hard look at a map “he could follow its features without referring to it again besides he possessed an almost intuitive knowledge of topography and never became confused as to the points of the compass” this gift was complemented by superb horsemanship which allowed grant to see for himself as much of the battlefield as possible\\n\\nin the eastern theater which he studied for only eight weeks grant revealed a thorough grasp of the strategic situation he decided to leave executive command of the army of the potomac to george g meade in order to give himself time to manage an extensive area of operations stretching from new england to new mexico from minnesota to mississippi “wherever lee goes” he ordered meade “there you will go also” keeping lee’s army engaged grant unleashed philip sheridan’s cavalry on the shenandoah valley the breadbasket of the confederacy and freed sherman to march through the south destroying railroads supplies—and morale\\nhe never lost sight of the bigger picture\\nyet none of this would have been possible had grant not also comprehended the war’s larger political context and harmonized his efforts on the battlefield with the aims of the lincoln administration as the latter enlarged from preservation of the union to the freeing of enslaved persons in the confederacy with the emancipation proclamation of 1863 grant’s policies and vision likewise evolved his way of prosecuting the war and securing the peace revealed a sure understanding of the war’s political stakes—and of the fact that the south’s best hope of victory was to sap the political will of the north by prolonging the war\\n\\nfor grant who as a young man had fought in the mexican war a conflict in which he did not believe the civil war was a war of principle at the conclusion of his memoirs he sums it up with his customary lucidity when he describes the confederate cause as “one of the worst for which a people ever fought and one for which there was the least excuse”world war i began in 1914 after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand and lasted until 1918 during the conflict germany austriahungary bulgaria and the ottoman empire the central powers fought against great britain france russia

would support their cause austrohungarian leaders feared that a russian intervention would involve russia’s ally france and possibly great britain as well\\n\\non july 5 kaiser wilhelm secretly pledged his support giving austriahungary a socalled carte blanche or “blank check” assurance of germany’s backing in the case of war the dual monarchy of austriahungary then sent an ultimatum to serbia with such harsh terms as to make it almost impossible to accept\\nworld war i begins\\nconvinced that austriahungary was readying for war the serbian government ordered the serbian army to

the germanheld regions of east prussia and poland but were stopped short by german and austrian forces at the battle of tannenberg in late august 1914\\ndespite that victory russia’s assault had forced germany to move two corps from the western front to the eastern contributing to the german loss in the battle of the marne\\n\\ncombined with the fierce allied resistance in france the ability of russia’s huge war machine to mobilize relatively quickly in the east ensured a longer more grueling conflict instead of the quick victory germany had hoped to win under the schlieffen planrussian

recognised by unesco in 1980 this archaeological site is set at a height of 1000m above sea level and is surrounded by an impressively beautiful mountainous setting as one of the most precisely dated

hötzendorf and the foreign minister leopold graf von berchtold saw the crime as the occasion for measures to humiliate serbia and so to enhance austriahungary’s prestige in the balkans conrad had already october 1913 been assured by william ii of germany’s support if austriahungary should start a preventive war against serbia this assurance was confirmed in the week following the assassination

germany to deter russia from intervention though the terms of the ultimatum were finally approved on july 19 its delivery was postponed to the evening of july 23 since by that time the french president raymond poincaré and his premier rené viviani who had set off on a state visit to russia on july 15 would be on their way home and therefore unable to concert an immediate reaction with their russian allies when the delivery was announced on july 24 russia declared that austriahungary must not be allowed to crush serbia\\n\\nserbia replied to the ultimatum on july 25 accepting most of its demands but protesting against two of them—namely that serbian officials unnamed should be dismissed at austriahungary’s behest and that austrohungarian officials should take part on serbian

ordered partial mobilization\\n\\nhome from his cruise on july 27 william learned on july 28 how serbia had replied to the ultimatum at once he instructed the german foreign office to tell austriahungary that there was no longer any justification for war and that it should content itself with a temporary occupation of belgrade but meanwhile the german foreign office had been giving such encouragement to berchtold that already on july 27 he had persuaded franz joseph to authorize war against serbia war was in fact declared on july 28 and austrohungarian artillery began to bombard belgrade the next day russia then ordered partial mobilization against austriahungary and on july 30 when austriahungary was riposting conventionally with an order of mobilization on its russian frontier russia ordered general mobilization germany which since july 28 had still been hoping in disregard of earlier warning hints from great britain that austriahungary’s war against serbia could

people imagined how long or how disastrous a war between the great nations of europe could be and most believed that their country’s side would be victorious within a matter of months the war was welcomed either patriotically as a defensive one imposed by national necessity or idealistically as one for upholding right against might the sanctity of treaties and international moralityworld war i\\nworld war i often abbreviated as wwi or ww1 also known as the first world war or the great war was a global war originating in europe that lasted from 28 july 1914 to 11 november 1918 contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars7 it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel including 60 million europeans making it one of the largest wars in history it is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history with an estimated nine million combatant and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war while resulting genocides and the

footing\\n\\na network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the balkans to one involving most of europe by july 1914 the great powers of europe were divided into two coalitions the triple entente—consisting of france russia and britain—and the triple alliance of germany austriahungary and italy the triple alliance was only defensive in nature allowing italy to stay out of the war until april 1915 when it joined the allied powers after its relations with austriahungary deteriorated russia felt it necessary to back serbia and after austriahungary shelled the serbian capital of belgrade on the 28 july approved partial mobilisation full russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 july on the 31st austriahungary and germany did the same while germany demanded russia demobilise within twelve hours when russia failed to comply germany declared war on russia on 1 august in support of austriahungary with austriahungary following suit on 6 august france ordered full mobilisation in support of russia on 2 august\\n\\ngerman strategy for a war on two fronts against france and russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the west to defeat france within six weeks then shift forces to the east before russia could fully mobilise this was later known as the schlieffen plan on 2 august germany demanded free passage through belgium an essential element in achieving a quick victory over france when this was refused german forces invaded belgium on 3 august and declared war on france the same day the belgian government invoked the 1839 treaty of london and in compliance with its obligations under this britain declared war on germany on 4 august on 12 august britain and france also declared war on austriahungary on the 23 august japan sided with britain seizing german possessions in china and the pacific in november 1914 the ottoman empire entered the war on the side of the central powers opening fronts in the caucasus mesopotamia and the sinai peninsula the war was fought in and drew upon each powers colonial empire as well spreading the conflict to africa and across the globe the entente and its allies would eventually become known as the allied powers while the grouping of austriahungary germany and their allies would become known as the central powers\\n\\nthe german advance into france was halted at the battle of the marne and by the end of 1914 the western front settled into a battle of attrition marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 the eastern front by contrast was marked by much greater exchanges of territory in 1915 italy joined the allied powers and opened a front in the alps bulgaria joined the central powers in 1915 and greece joined the allies in 1917 expanding the war in the balkans the united states initially remained neutral though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the allies eventually after the sinking of american merchant ships by german submarines the declaration by germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping and the revelation that germany was trying to incite mexico to make war on the united states the us declared war on germany on 6 april 1917 trained american forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid1918 but ultimately the american expeditionary force would reach some two million troops\\n\\nthough serbia was defeated in 1915 and romania joined the allied powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917 none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918 the 1917 february revolution in russia replaced the tsarist autocracy with the provisional government but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the october revolution the creation of the soviet socialist republic and the signing of the treaty of brestlitovsk by the new government in march 1918 ending russias involvement in the war this allowed the transfer of large numbers of german troops from the east to the western front resulting in the german march 1918 offensive this offensive was initially successful but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the german reserves the allies rallied and drove the germans back in their hundred days offensive a continual series of attacks to which the germans had no reply bulgaria was the first central power to sign an armistice—the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918 on 30 october the ottoman empire capitulated signing the armistice of mudroson 4 november the austrohungarian empire agreed to the armistice of villa giusti with its allies defeated revolution at home and the military no longer willing to fight kaiser wilhelm abdicated on 9 november and germany signed an armistice on 11 november 1918 effectively ending the war\\n\\nworld war i was a significant turning point in the political cultural economic and social climate of the world the war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings the big four britain france the united states and italy imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 paris peace conference the most well known being the german peace treaty—the treaty of versailles ultimately as a result of the war the austrohungarian german ottoman and russian empires ceased to exist with numerous new states created from their remains however despite the conclusive allied victory and the creation of the league of nations during the peace conference intended to prevent future wars a second world war would follow just over twenty years laterforces and resources of the combatant nations in 1914\\nwhen war broke out the allied powers possessed greater overall demographic industrial and military resources than the central powers and enjoyed easier access to the oceans for trade with neutral countries particularly with the united states\\n\\nall the initial belligerents in world war i were selfsufficient in food except great britain and germany great britain’s industrial establishment was slightly superior to germany’s 17 percent of world trade in 1913 as compared with 12 percent for germany but germany’s diversified chemical industry facilitated the production of ersatz or substitute materials which compensated for the worst shortages ensuing from the british wartime blockade the german chemist fritz haber was already developing a process for the fixation of nitrogen from air this process made germany selfsufficient in explosives and thus no longer dependent on imports of nitrates from chile\\n\\nof all the initial belligerent nations only great britain had a volunteer army and this was quite small at the start of the war the other nations had much larger conscript armies that required three to four years of service from ablebodied males of military age to be followed by several years in reserve formations military strength on land was counted in terms of divisions composed of 12000–20000 officers and men two or more divisions made up an army corps and two or more corps made up an army an army could thus comprise anywhere from 50000 to 250000 men\\n\\nthe land forces of the belligerent nations at the outbreak of war in august 1914 are shown in table 2\\n\\nthe higher state of discipline training leadership and armament of the german army reduced the importance of the initial numerical inferiority of the armies of the central powers because of the comparative slowness of mobilization poor higher leadership and lower scale of armament of the russian armies there was an approximate balance of forces between the central powers and the allies in august 1914 that prevented either side from gaining a quick victory\\n\\ngermany and austria also enjoyed the advantage of “interior lines of communication” which enabled them to send their forces to critical points on the battlefronts by the shortest route according to one estimate germany’s railway network made it possible to move eight divisions simultaneously from the western front to the eastern front in four and a half days\\n\\neven greater in importance was the advantage that germany derived from its strong military traditions and its cadre of highly efficient and disciplined regular officers skilled in directing a war of movement and quick to exploit the advantages of flank attacks german senior officers were to prove generally more capable than their allied counterparts at directing the operations of large troop formations\\n\\nsea power was largely reckoned in terms of capital ships or dreadnought battleships and battle cruisers having extremely large guns despite intensive competition from the germans the british had maintained their superiority in numbers with the result that in capital ships the allies had an almost twotoone advantage over the central powers\\n\\nthe strength of the two principal rivals at sea great britain and germany is compared in table 3\\n\\nthe numerical superiority of the british navy however was offset by the technological lead of the german navy in many categories such as rangefinding equipment magazine protection searchlights torpedoes and mines great britain relied on the royal navy not only to ensure necessary imports of food and other supplies in wartime but also to sever the central powers’ access to the markets of the world with superior numbers of warships great britain could impose a blockade that gradually weakened germany by preventing imports from overseastechnology of war in 1914\\nthe planning and conduct of war in 1914 were crucially influenced by the invention of new weapons and the improvement of existing types since the francogerman war of 1870–71 the chief developments of the intervening period had been the machine gun and the rapidfire field artillery gun the modern machine gun which had been developed in the 1880s and ’90s was a reliable beltfed gun capable of sustained rates of extremely rapid fire it could fire 600 bullets per minute with a range of more than 1000 yards 900 metres in the realm of field artillery the period leading up to the war saw the introduction of improved breechloading mechanisms and brakes without a brake or recoil mechanism a gun lurched out of position during firing and had to be reaimed after each round the new improvements were epitomized in the french 75millimetre field gun it remained motionless during firing and it was not necessary to readjust the aim in order to bring sustained fire on a target\\n\\nmachine guns and rapidfiring artillery when used in combination with trenches and barbedwire emplacements gave a decided advantage to the defense since these weapons’ rapid and sustained firepower could decimate a frontal assault by either infantry or cavalry\\n\\nthere was a considerable disparity in 1914 between the deadly effectiveness of modern armaments and the doctrinal teachings of some armies the south african war and the russojapanese war had revealed the futility of frontal infantry or cavalry attacks on prepared positions when unaccompanied by surprise but few military leaders foresaw that the machine gun and the rapidfiring field gun would force armies into trenches in order to survive instead war was looked upon by many leaders in 1914 as a contest of national wills spirit and courage a prime example of this attitude was the french army which was dominated by the doctrine of the offensive french military doctrine called for headlong bayonet charges of french infantrymen against the german rifles machine guns and artillery german military thinking under the influence of alfred graf von schlieffen sought unlike the french to avoid frontal assaults but rather to achieve an early decision by deep flanking attacks and at the same time to make use of reserve divisions alongside regular formations from the outset of war the germans paid greater attention to training their officers in defensive tactics using machine guns barbed wire and fortifications7 reasons ulysses s grant was one of america’s most brilliant military leaders\\nwhat he lacked in knowledge of military art and science he made up for with tenacity and grit\\nin march 1864 ulysses s grant went to washington dc to receive his commission from abraham lincoln as lieutenant general in command of all the union armies after several years of frustration with a parade of unsuitable commanders the president had finally found the man who would defeat robert e lee’s army of northern virginia and thus effectively end the civil war the choice was surprising to many who had known grant in former days ten years before in april 1854 captain grant had submitted his resignation under a cloud\\n\\nin one of history’s unexpected developments the military profession grant “had always disliked” in the words of his biographer bruce catton ultimately “turned out to be the calling made for him” how did an ambivalent soldier who had been away from the army for several years—and who had drifted during that interval from one civilian occupation to another in search of elusive success—end up leading a vast force to victory and saving the union\\n\\ngrant’s predecessors in command of the union army were far more accomplished in military art and science winfield scott whose experience dated back to the war of 1812 had led the army since 1841 george b mcclellan who replaced the aging scott early in the civil war was an able administrator who

military art  science was regarded as a master theoreticianthe war in the west 1914\\nthe german invasion\\nfor the smooth working of their plan for the invasion of france the germans had preliminarily to reduce the ring fortress of liège which commanded the route prescribed for their 1st and 2nd armies and which was the foremost stronghold of the belgian defenses german troops crossed the frontier into belgium on the morning of august 4 thanks to the resolution of a middleaged staff officer erich ludendorff a german brigade occupied the town of liège itself in the night of august 5–6 and the citadel on august 7 but the surrounding forts held out stubbornly until the germans brought their heavy howitzers into action against them on august 12 these 420millimetre siege guns proved too formidable for the forts which one by one succumbed the vanguard of the german invasion was already pressing the belgian field army between the gete river and brussels when the last of the liège forts fell on august 16 the belgians then withdrew northward to the entrenched camp of antwerp on august 20 the german 1st army entered brussels while the 2nd army appeared before namur the one remaining fortress barring the meuse route into france\\nthe initial clashes between the french and german armies along the francogerman and francobelgian frontiers are collectively known as the battle of the frontiers this group of engagements which lasted from august 14 until the beginning of the first battle of the marne on september 6 was to be the largest battle of the war and was perhaps the largest battle in human history up to that time given the fact that a total of more than two million troops were involved\\n\\nthe planned french thrust into lorraine totaling 19 divisions started on august 14 but was shattered by the german 6th and 7th armies in the battle of morhangesarrebourg august 20–22 yet this abortive french offensive had an indirect effect on the german plan for when the french attack in lorraine developed moltke was tempted momentarily to postpone the rightwing sweep and instead to seek a victory in lorraine this fleeting impulse led him to divert to lorraine the six newly formed ersatz divisions that had been intended to increase the weight of his right wing this was the first of several impromptu decisions by moltke that were to fatally impair the execution of the schlieffen plan\\n\\nmeanwhile the german imperial princes who commanded armies on the germans’ left southern wing in lorraine were proving unwilling to forfeit their opportunity for personal glory crown prince rupert of bavaria on august 20 ordered his 6th army to counterattack instead of continuing to fall back before the french advance as planned and crown prince william of germany ordered his 5th army to do the same the strategic result of these unplanned german offensives was merely to throw the french back onto a fortified barrier that both restored and augmented their power of resistance thus the french were soon afterward enabled to dispatch troops to reinforce their left flank—a redistribution of strength that was to have farreaching results in the decisive battle of the marne\\nwhile this seesaw campaign in lorraine was taking place more decisive events were occurring to the northwest the german attack on liège had awakened joffre to the reality of a german advance through belgium but not to its strength or to the wideness of its sweep in preparing a counterattack against the german advance through belgium joffre envisaged a pincer movement with the french 3rd and 4th armies on the right and the 5th supported by the bef on the left to trap the germans in the meuse–ardennes area south of liège the fundamental flaw in this new french plan was that the germans had deployed about 50 percent more troops than the french had estimated and for a vaster enveloping movement consequently while the righthand claw of the french pincer 23 divisions collided with the german 5th and 4th armies 20 divisions in the ardennes and was thrown back the lefthand claw 13 french and four british divisions found itself nearly trapped between the german 1st and 2nd armies with a total of 30 divisions on the one hand and the 3rd on the other as the french 5th army under general charles lanrezac was checked in its offensive south of the sambre river by a german attack on august 21 the british who reached mons on august 22 at first agreed to stand there to cover lanrezac’s left but on august 23 news of the fall of namur and of the german 3rd army’s presence near dinant induced lanrezac to wisely order a general retreat and on august 24 the british began their retreat from mons just in time to escape envelopment by the german 1st army’s westward march around their unprotected left flank\\n\\nat last joffre realized the truth and the utter collapse of plan xvii resolution was his greatest asset and with imperturbable coolness he formed a new plan out of the wreckage joffre decided to swing the allied centre and left back southwestward from the belgian frontier to a line pivoted on the french fortress of verdun and at the same time to withdraw some strength from the right wing so as to be able to station a newly created 6th army on the extreme left north of paris this plan might in turn have collapsed if the germans had not themselves departed from schlieffen’s original plan due to a combination of moltke’s indecisiveness poor communications between his headquarters and the field army commanders of the german right wing and moltke’s resulting confusion about the developing tactical situation in the first place the german right wing was weakened by the subtraction of 11 divisions four were detached to watch antwerp and to invest french fortresses near the belgian frontier instead of using reserve and ersatz troops for this as earlier intended and seven more regular divisions were transferred to check the russian advance into east prussia see below in the second place alexander von kluck in command of the 1st army did in fact wheel inward north of paris rather than southwest of the city\\n\\nkluck’s change of direction meant the inevitable abandonment of the original wide sweep around the far western side of paris now the flank of this wheeling german line would pass the near side of paris and across the face of the paris defenses into the valley of the marne river the premature inward wheel of kluck’s 1st army before paris had been reached thus exposed the german extreme right wing to a flank attack and a possible counterenvelopment on september 4 moltke decided to abandon the original schlieffen plan and substituted a new one the german 4th and 5th armies should drive southeastward from the ardennes into french lorraine west of verdun and then converge with the southwestward advance of the 6th and 7th armies from alsace against the toul–épinal line of fortifications so as to envelop the whole french right wing the 1st and 2nd armies in the marne valley should stand guard meanwhile against any french countermove from the vicinity of paris but such an allied countermove had already begun before the new german plan could be put into effect\\n\\nlearn more\\nthe first battle of the marne\\nalready on september 3 general js gallieni the military governor of paris had guessed the significance of the german 1st army’s swing inward to the marne east of paris on september 4 joffre convinced by gallieni’s arguments decisively ordered his whole left wing to turn about from their retreat and to begin a general offensive against the germans’ exposed right flank on september 6 the french 6th army under mj maunoury forewarned by gallieni had actually begun attacking on september 5 and its pressure caused kluck finally to engage the whole 1st army in support of his right flank when he was still no farther up the marne valley than meaux with nothing but a cavalry screen stretched across the 30 miles between him and karl von bülow’s 2nd army at montmirail while the french 5th army was turning to attack bülow the bef between the 5th and the 6th armies was still continuing its retreat for another day but on september 9 bülow learned that the british too had turned and were advancing into the gap between him and kluck he therefore ordered the 2nd army to retreat thus obliging kluck to do likewise with the 1st the counterattack of the french 5th and 6th armies and the bef developed into a general counterattack by the entire left and centre of the french army this counterattack is known as the first battle of the marne by september 11 the german retreat extended to all the german armies\\n\\nthere were several reasons for this extraordinary turn of events chief among them was the utter exhaustion of the german soldiery of the right wing some of whom had marched more than 150 miles 240 kilometres under conditions of frequent battle their fatigue was ultimately a byproduct of the schlieffen plan itself for while the retreating french had been able to move troops by rail to various points within the circle formed by the front the german troops had found their advance hampered by demolished bridges and destroyed rail lines their food and ammunition supply was consequently restricted and the troops also had to make their advance by foot moreover the germans had underestimated the resilient spirit of the french troops who had maintained their courage and morale and their confidence in their commanders this fact was strikingly evidenced by the comparatively small number of prisoners taken by the germans in the course of what was undeniably a precipitous french retreat\\n\\nmeanwhile the assault by the german 6th and 7th armies on the defenses of the french eastern frontier had already proved a predictably expensive failure and the german attempt at a partial envelopment pivoted on verdun was abandoned the german right wing withdrew northward from the marne and made a firm stand along the lower aisne river and the chemin des dames ridge along the aisne the preponderant power of the defense over the offense was reemphasized as the germans repelled successive allied attacks from the shelter of trenches the first battle of the aisne marked the real beginning of trench warfare on the western front both sides were in the process of discovering that in lieu of frontal assaults for which neither had the manpower readily available the only alternative was to try to overlap and envelop the other’s flank in this case the one on the side pointing toward the north sea and the english channel thus began the “race to the sea” in which the developing trench networks of both sides were quickly extended northwestward until they reached the atlantic at a point just inside coastal belgium west of ostend\\n\\nthe first battle of the marne succeeded in pushing the germans back for a distance of 40 to 50 miles and thus saved the capital city of paris from capture in this respect it was a great strategic victory since it enabled the french to renew their confidence and to continue the war but the great german offensive though unsuccessful in its object of knocking france out of the war had enabled the germans to capture a large portion of northeastern france the loss of this heavily industrialized region which contained much of the country’s coal iron and steel production was a serious blow to the continuation of the french war effort\\n\\nthe belgian army meanwhile had fallen back to the fortress city of antwerp which ended up behind the german lines the germans began a heavy bombardment of antwerp on september 28 and antwerp surrendered to the germans on october 10\\n\\nafter the failure of his first two attempts to turn the germans’ western flank one on the somme the other near arras joffre obstinately decided to try again yet farther north with the bef—which in any case was being moved northward from the aisne the bef accordingly was deployed between la bassée and ypres while on the left the belgians—who had wisely declined to participate in the projected attack—continued the front along the yser down to the channel erich von falkenhayn however who on september 14 had succeeded moltke as chief of the german general staff had foreseen what was coming and had prepared a counterplan one of his armies transferred from lorraine was to check the expected offensive while another was to sweep down the coast and crush the attackers’ left flank the british attack was launched from ypres on october 19 the german thrust the next day though the belgians of the yser had been under increasing pressure for two days already both sir john french and ferdinand foch joffre’s deputy in the north were slow to appreciate what was happening to their “offensive” but in the night of october 29–30 the belgians had to open the sluices on the yser river to save themselves by flooding the germans’ path down the coast the battle of ypres had its worst crises on october 31 and november 11 and did not die down into trench warfare until november 22\\n\\nby the end of 1914 the casualties the french had so far sustained in the war totaled about 380000 killed and 600000 wounded the germans had lost a slightly smaller number with the repulse of the german attempt to break through at the battle of ypres the strained and exhausted armies of both sides settled down into trench warfare the trench barrier was consolidated from the swiss frontier to the atlantic the power of modern defense had triumphed over the attack and stalemate ensued the military history of the western front during the next three years was to be a story of the allies’ attempts to break this deadlockthe eastern and other fronts 1914\\nlearn more\\nthe war in the east 1914\\non the eastern front greater distances and quite considerable differences between the equipment and quality of the opposing armies ensured a fluidity of the front that was lacking in the west trench lines might form but to break them was not difficult particularly for the german army and then mobile operations of the old style could be undertaken\\n\\nurged by the french to take offensive action against the germans the russian commander in chief grand duke nicholas took it loyally but prematurely before the cumbrous russian war machine was ready by launching a pincer movement against east prussia under the higher control of general yag zhilinsky two armies the 1st or vilna army under pk rennenkampf and the 2nd or warsaw army under av samsonov were to converge with a twotoone superiority in numbers on the german 8th army in east prussia from the east and the south respectively rennenkampf’s left flank would be separated by 50 miles from samsonov’s right flank\\n\\nmax von prittwitz und gaffron commander of the 8th army with his headquarters at neidenburg nidzica had seven divisions and one cavalry division on his eastern front but only the three divisions of friedrich von scholtz’s xx corps on his southern he was therefore dismayed to learn on august 20 when the bulk of his forces had been repulsed at gumbinnen august 19–20 by rennenkampf’s attack from the east that samsonov’s 13 divisions had crossed the southern frontier of east prussia and were thus threatening his rear he initially considered a general retreat but when his staff objected to this he approved their counterproposal of an attack on samsonov’s left flank for which purpose three divisions were to be switched in haste by rail from the gumbinnen front to reinforce scholtz the rest of the gumbinnen troops could make their retreat by road the principal exponent of this counterproposal was lieutenant colonel max hoffmann prittwitz having moved his headquarters northward to mühlhausen młynary was surprised on august 22 by a telegram announcing that general paul von hindenburg with ludendorff as his chief of staff was coming to supersede him in command arriving the next day ludendorff readily confirmed hoffmann’s dispositions for the blow at samsonov’s left\\n\\nmeanwhile zhilinsky was not only giving rennenkampf time to reorganize after gumbinnen but even instructing him to invest königsberg instead of pressing on to the west when the germans on august 25 learned from an intercepted russian wireless message the russians habitually transmitted combat directives “in clear” not in code that rennenkampf was in no hurry to advance ludendorff saw a new opportunity developing the plan put forward by hoffmann ludendorff concentrated about six divisions against samsonov’s left wing this force inferior in strength could not have been decisive but ludendorff then took the calculated risk of withdrawing the rest of the german troops except for a cavalry screen from their confrontation with rennenkampf and rushing them southwestward against samsonov’s right wing thus august von mackensen’s xvii corps was taken from near gumbinnen and moved southward to duplicate the planned german attack on samsonov’s left with an attack on his right thus completely enveloping the russian 2nd army this daring move was made possible by the notable absence of communication between the two russian field commanders whom hoffmann knew to personally dislike each other under the germans’ converging blows samsonov’s flanks were crushed and his centre surrounded during august 26–31 the outcome of this military masterpiece called the battle of tannenberg was the destruction or capture of almost the whole of samsonov’s army the history of imperial russia’s unfortunate participation in world war i is epitomized in the ignominious outcome of the battle of tannenberg\\n\\nthe progress of the battle was as follows samsonov his forces spread out along a front 60 miles long was gradually pushing scholtz back toward the allenstein–osterode olsztyn–ostróda line when on august 26 ludendorff ordered general hermann von françois with the i corps on scholtz’s right to attack samsonov’s left wing near usdau uzdowo there on august 27 german artillery bombardments threw the hungry and weary russians into precipitate flight françois started to pursue them toward neidenburg in the rear of the russian centre and then made a momentary diversion southward to check a russian counterattack from soldau działdowo two of the russian 2nd army’s six army corps managed to escape southeastward at this point and françois then resumed his pursuit to the east by nightfall on august 29 his troops were in control of the road leading from neidenburg eastward to willenberg wielbark the russian centre amounting to three army corps was now caught in the maze of forest between allenstein and the frontier of russian poland it had no line of retreat was surrounded by the germans and soon dissolved into mobs of hungry and exhausted men who beat feebly against the encircling german ring and then allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the thousands samsonov shot himself in despair on august 29 by the end of august the germans had taken 92000 prisoners and annihilated half of the russian 2nd army ludendorff’s bold recall of the last german forces facing rennenkampf’s army was wholly justified in the event since rennenkampf remained utterly passive while samsonov’s army was surrounded\\n\\nhaving received two fresh army corps seven divisions from the western front the germans now turned on the slowly advancing 1st army under rennenkampf the latter was attacked on a line extending from east of königsberg to the southern end of the chain of the masurian lakes during september 1–15 and was driven from east prussia as a result of these east prussian battles russia had lost about 250000 men and what could be afforded still less much war matériel but the invasion of east prussia had at least helped to make possible the french comeback on the marne by causing the dispatch of two german army corps from the western front\\n\\nhaving ended the russian threat to east prussia the germans could afford to switch the bulk of their forces from that area to the częstochowa–kraków front in southwestern poland where the austrian offensive launched on august 20 had been rolled back by russian counterattacks a new plan for simultaneous thrusts by the germans toward warsaw and by the austrians toward przemyśl was brought to nothing by the end of october as the russians could now mount counterattacks in overwhelming strength their mobilization being at last nearly completed the russians then mounted a powerful effort to invade prussian silesia with a huge phalanx of seven armies allied hopes rose high as the muchheralded “russian steamroller” as the huge russian army was called began its ponderous advance the russian armies were advancing toward silesia when hindenburg and ludendorff in november exploited the superiority of the german railway network when the retreating german forces had crossed the frontier back into prussian silesia they were promptly moved northward into prussian poland and thence sent southeastward to drive a wedge between the two armies of the russian right flank the massive russian operation against silesia was disorganized and within a week four new german army corps had arrived from the western front ludendorff was able to use them to press the russians back by middecember to the bzura–rawka rivers line in front of warsaw and the depletion of their munition supplies compelled the russians to also fall back in galicia to trench lines along the nida and dunajec rivers\\n\\nlearn more\\nthe serbian campaign 1914\\nthe first austrian invasion of serbia was launched with numerical inferiority part of one of the armies originally destined for the balkan front having been diverted to the eastern front on august 18 and the able serbian commander radomir putnik brought the invasion to an early end by his victories on the cer mountain august 15–20 and at šabac august 21–24 in early september however putnik’s subsequent northward offensive on the sava river in the north had to be broken off when the austrians began a second offensive against the serbs’ western front on the drina river after some weeks of deadlock the austrians began a third offensive which had some success in the battle of the kolubara and forced the serbs to evacuate belgrade on november 30 but by december 15 a serbian counterattack had retaken belgrade and forced the austrians to retreat mud and exhaustion kept the serbs from turning the austrian retreat into a rout but the victory sufficed to allow serbia a long spell of freedom from further austrian advances\\n\\nthe turkish entry\\nthe entry of turkey or the ottoman empire as it was then called into the war as a german ally was the one great success of german wartime diplomacy since 1909 turkey had been under the control of the young turks over whom germany had skillfully gained a dominating influence german military instructors permeated the turkish army and enver paşa the leader of the young turks saw alliance with germany as the best way of serving turkey’s interests in particular for protection against the russian threat to the straits he therefore persuaded the grand vizier said halim paşa to make a secret treaty negotiated late in july signed on august 2 pledging turkey to the german side if germany should have to take austriahungary’s side against russia the unforeseen entry of great britain into the war against germany alarmed the turks but the timely arrival of two german warships the goeben and the breslau in the dardanelles on august 10 turned the scales in favour of enver’s policy the ships were ostensibly sold to turkey but they retained their german crews the turks began detaining british ships and more antibritish provocations followed both in the straits and on the egyptian frontier finally the goeben led the turkish fleet across the black sea to bombard odessa and other russian ports october 29–30 russia declared war against turkey on november 1 and the western allies after an ineffective bombardment of the outer forts of the dardanelles on november 3 declared war likewise on november 5 a british force from india occupied basra on the persian gulf on november 21 in the winter of 1914–15 turkish offensives in the caucasus and in the sinai desert albeit abortive served german strategy well by tying russian and british forces down in those peripheral areasthe war at sea 1914–15\\nin august 1914 great britain with 29 capital ships ready and 13 under construction and germany with 18 and nine were the two great rival sea powers neither of them at first wanted a direct confrontation the british were chiefly concerned with the protection of their trade routes the germans hoped that mines and submarine attacks would gradually destroy great britain’s numerical superiority so that confrontation could eventually take place on equal terms\\nthe first significant encounter between the two navies was that of the helgoland bight on august 28 1914 when a british force under admiral sir david beatty having entered german home waters sank or damaged several german light cruisers and killed or captured 1000 men at a cost of one british ship damaged and 35 deaths for the following months the germans in european or british waters confined themselves to submarine warfare—not without some notable successes on september 22 a single german submarine or uboat sank three british cruisers within an hour on october 7 a uboat made its way into the anchorage of loch ewe on the west coast of scotland on october 15 the british cruiser hawke was torpedoed and on october 27 the british battleship audacious was sunk by a mine\\n\\non december 15 battle cruisers of the german high seas fleet set off on a sortie across the north sea under the command of admiral franz von hipper they bombarded several british towns and then made their way home safely hipper’s next sortie however was intercepted on its way out on january 24 1915 in the battle of the dogger bank the german cruiser blücher was sunk and two other cruisers damaged before the germans could make their escape\\n\\nabroad on the high seas the germans’ most powerful surface force was the east asiatic squadron of fast cruisers including the scharnhorst the gneisenau and the nürnberg under admiral graf maximilian von spee for four months this fleet ranged almost unhindered over the pacific ocean while the emden having joined the squadron in august 1914 was detached for service in the indian ocean the germans could thus threaten not only merchant shipping on the british trade routes but also troopships on their way to europe or the middle east from india new zealand or australia the emden sank merchant ships in the bay of bengal bombarded madras september 22 now chennai india haunted the approaches to ceylon sri lanka and had destroyed 15 allied ships in all before it was caught and sunk off the cocos islands on november 9 by the australian cruiser sydney\\n\\nmeanwhile admiral von spee’s main squadron since august had been threading a devious course in the pacific from the caroline islands toward the chilean coast and had been joined by two more cruisers the leipzig and the dresden on november 1 in the battle of coronel it inflicted a sensational defeat on a british force under sir christopher cradock which had sailed from the atlantic to hunt it down without losing a single ship it sank cradock’s two major cruisers cradock himself being killed but the fortunes of the war on the high seas were reversed when on december 8 the german squadron attacked the falkland malvinas islands in the south atlantic probably unaware of the naval strength that the british since coronel had been concentrating there under admiral sir doveton sturdee two battle cruisers the invincible and inflexible each equipped with eight 12inch guns and six other cruisers the german ships were suffering from wear and tear after their long cruise in the pacific and were no match for the newer faster british ships which soon overtook them the scharnhorst with admiral von spee aboard was the first ship to be sunk then the gneisenau followed by the nürnberg and the leipzig the british ships which had fought at long range so as to render useless the smaller guns of the germans sustained only 25 casualties in this engagement when the german light cruiser dresden was caught and sunk off the juan fernández islands on march 14 1915 commerce raiding by german surface ships on the high seas was at an end it was just beginning by german submarines however\\n\\nthe belligerent navies were employed as much in interfering with commerce as in fighting each other immediately after the outbreak of war the british had instituted an economic blockade of germany with the aim of preventing all supplies reaching that country from the outside world the two routes by which supplies could reach german ports were 1 through the english channel and the strait of dover and 2 around the north of scotland a minefield laid in the strait of dover with a narrow free lane made it fairly easy to intercept and search ships using the channel to the north of scotland however there was an area of more than 200000 square miles 520000 square kilometres to be patrolled and the task was assigned to a squadron of armed merchant cruisers during the early months of the war only absolute contraband such as guns and ammunition was restricted but the list was gradually extended to include almost all material that might be of use to the enemy\\n\\nthe prevention of the free passage of trading ships led to considerable difficulties among the neutral nations particularly with the united states whose trading interests were hampered by british policy nevertheless the british blockade was extremely effective and during 1915 the british patrols stopped and inspected more than 3000 vessels of which 743 were sent into port for examination outwardbound trade from germany was brought to a complete standstill\\n\\nthe germans similarly sought to attack great britain’s economy with a campaign against its supply lines of merchant shipping in 1915 however with their surface commerce raiders eliminated from the conflict they were forced to rely entirely on the submarine\\n\\nthe germans began their submarine campaign against commerce by sinking a british merchant steamship glitra after evacuating the crew on october 20 1914 a number of other sinkings followed and the germans soon became convinced that the submarine would be able to bring the british to an early peace where the commerce raiders on the high seas had failed on january 30 1915 germany carried the campaign a stage further by torpedoing three british steamers tokomaru ikaria and oriole without warning they next announced on february 4 that from february 18 they would treat the waters around the british isles as a war zone in which all allied merchant ships were to be destroyed and in which no ship whether enemy or not would be immune\\n\\nyet whereas the allied blockade was preventing almost all trade for germany from reaching that nation’s ports the german submarine campaign yielded less satisfactory results during the first week of the campaign seven allied or alliedbound ships were sunk out of 11 attacked but 1370 others sailed without being harassed by the german submarines in the whole of march 1915 during which 6000 sailings were recorded only 21 ships were sunk and in april only 23 ships from a similar number apart from its lack of positive success the uboat arm was continuously harried by great britain’s extensive antisubmarine measures which included nets specially armed merchant ships hydrophones for locating the noise of a submarine’s engines and depth bombs for destroying it underwater\\n\\nfor the germans a worse result than any of the british countermeasures imposed on them was the longterm growth of hostility on the part of the neutral countries certainly the neutrals were far from happy with the british blockade but the german declaration of the war zone and subsequent events turned them progressively away from their attitude of sympathy for germany the hardening of their outlook began in february 1915 when the norwegian steamship belridge carrying oil from new orleans to amsterdam was torpedoed and sunk in the english channel the germans continued to sink neutral ships occasionally and undecided countries soon began to adopt a hostile outlook toward this activity when the safety of their own shipping was threatened\\n\\nmuch more serious was an action that confirmed the inability of the german command to perceive that a minor tactical success could constitute a strategic blunder of the most extreme magnitude this was the sinking by a german submarine on may 7 1915 of the british liner lusitania which was on its way from new york to liverpool though the ship was in fact carrying 173 tons of ammunition it had nearly 2000 civilian passengers and the 1198 people who were drowned included 128 us citizens the loss of the liner and so many of its passengers including the americans aroused a wave of indignation in the united states and it was fully expected that a declaration of war might follow but the us government clung to its policy of neutrality and contented itself with sending several notes of protest to germany despite this the germans persisted in their intention and on august 17 sank the arabic which also had us and other neutral passengers following a new us protest the germans undertook to ensure the safety of passengers before sinking liners henceforth but only after the torpedoing of yet another liner the hesperia did germany on september 18 decide to suspend its submarine campaign in the english channel and west of the british isles for fear of provoking the united states further the german civilian statesmen had temporarily prevailed over the naval high command which advocated “unrestricted” submarine warfarethe loss of the german colonies\\ngermany’s overseas colonies virtually without hope of reinforcement from europe defended themselves with varying degrees of success

kamerun invaded by allied forces from the south the east and the northwest in august 1914 and attacked from the sea in the west the germans put up a more effective resistance and the last german stronghold there mora held out until february 18 1916\\n\\noperations by south african forces in huge numerical superiority were launched against german south west africa namibia in september 1914 but were held up by the progerman rebellion of certain south african officers who had fought against the british in the south african war of 1899–1902 the rebellion died out in february 1915 but the

west and with an independent british one from nyasaland in the south but though dar es salaam fell to smuts and tabora to the belgians in september lettowvorbeck maintained his small force in being in november 1917 he began to move southward across portuguese east africa germany had declared war on portugal in march 1916 and after crossing back into german east africa in september 1918 he turned

front had become clear to the governments of the warring countries and even to many members of their general staffs each side sought a solution to this deadlock and the solutions varied in form and manner\\n\\nerich von falkenhayn had succeeded the dispirited moltke as chief of the german general staff in september 1914 by the end of 1914 falkenhayn seems to have concluded that although the final decision would be reached in the west germany had no immediate prospect of success there and that the only practicable theatre of operations in the near future was the eastern front however inconclusive those operations might be falkenhayn was convinced of the strength of the allied trench barrier in france so he took the momentous decision to stand on the defensive in the west\\n\\nfalkenhayn saw that a long war was now inevitable and set to work to develop germany’s resources for such a warfare of attrition thus the technique of field entrenchment was carried to a higher pitch by the germans than by any other country germany’s military railways were expanded for the lateral movement of reserves and the problem of the supply of munitions and of the raw materials for their manufacture was tackled so energetically and comprehensively that an ample flow was ensured from the spring of 1915 onward—a time when the british were only awakening to the problem here were laid the foundations of that economic organization and utilization of resources that was to be the secret of germany’s power to resist the pressure of the british blockade\\n\\nthe western allies were divided into two camps about strategy joffre and most of the french general staff backed by the british field marshal sir john french argued for continuing assaults on the germans’ entrenched line in france despite the continued attrition of french forces that this strategy entailed apart from this the french high command was singularly lacking in ideas to break the deadlock of trench warfare while desire to hold on to territorial gains governed the german strategy the desire to recover lost territory dominated the french\\n\\nbritishinspired solutions to the deadlock crystallized into two main groups one tactical the other strategical the first was to unlock the trench barrier by inventing a machine that would be invulnerable to machine guns and capable of crossing trenches and would thus restore the tactical balance upset by the new preponderance of defensive over offensive power such a machine had long been contemplated and the early years of the 20th century saw the first attempts at a practical armoured fighting vehicle british efforts were nourished and tended in infancy by winston churchill then first lord of the admiralty and ultimately after months of experiment hampered by official opposition came to maturity in 1916 in the weapon known as the tank some of the british strategists on the other hand argued that instead of seeking a breakthrough on the germans’ impregnable western front the allies should turn the whole position of the central powers either by an offensive through the balkans or even by a landing on germany’s baltic coast joffre and his supporters won the argument and the balkan projects were relinquished in favour of a concentration of effort on the western front but misgivings were not silenced and a situation arose that revived the middle eastern scheme in a new if attenuated form\\nearly in january 1915 the russians threatened by the turks in the caucasus appealed to the british for some relieving action against turkey the british after acrimonious argument among themselves decided in favour of “a naval expedition in february to bombard and take the gallipoli peninsula the western shore of the dardanelles with constantinople as its objective” though subsequently it was agreed that army troops might be provided to hold the shores if the fleet forced the straits the naval attack began on february 19 without army support when at last sir ian hamilton’s troops from egypt began to land on the turkish shores on april 25 the turks and their german commander otto liman von sanders had had ample time to prepare adequate fortifications and the defending armies were now six times as large as when the campaign opened\\nagainst resolute opposition from the local turkish commander mustafa kemal the future atatürk australian and new zealand troops won a bridgehead at “anzac cove” north of kaba tepe on the aegean side of the peninsula with some 20000 men landing in the first two days the british meanwhile tried to land at five points around cape helles but established footholds only at three of them and then asked for reinforcements thereafter little progress was made and the turks took advantage of the british halt to bring into the peninsula as many troops as possible the standstill of the enterprise led to a political crisis in london between churchill the liberal government’s first lord of the admiralty who after earlier doubts had made himself the foremost spokesman of the dardanelles operation and john lord fisher the first sea lord who had always expressed doubts about it fisher demanded on may 14 that the operation be discontinued and when he was overruled resigned the next day the liberal government was replaced by a coalition but churchill though relieved of his former post remained in the war council of the cabinet\\nin july the british began sending five more divisions to the peninsula and a new plan was hatched in the hope of cutting the turks’ north–south communications down the peninsula by seizing the sari bair heights which commanded the straits from the west the british reinforced the bridgehead at “anzac cove” and in the night of august 6–7 landed more troops at suvla bay anafarta limanı farther to the north within a few days both the offensive from “anzac” and the new landing had proved ineffectual more argument ensued in the war council and only late in the year was it acknowledged that the initially promising but illconducted enterprise should be given up the evacuation of the troops was carried out from suvla bay and from “anzac cove” under cover of darkness in december 1915 and from the cape helles beaches in january 1916 the dardanelles campaign thus came to a frustrating end had it succeeded it might well have ended turkey’s

1915 on the germans’ trench barrier in champagne won only 500 yards 460 metres of ground at a cost of 50000 men for the british sir douglas haig’s 1st army between armentières and lens tried a new experiment at neuvechapelle on march 10 when its artillery opened an intense bombardment on a 2000yard front and then after 35 minutes lengthened its range so that the attacking british infantry behind the second screen of shells could overrun the trenches ravaged by the first but the experiment’s immediate result was merely loss of life both because shortage of munitions made the second barrage inadequate and because there was a fivehour delay in launching the infantry assault against which the germans having overcome their initial surprise had time to rally their resistance it was clear to the allies that this smallscale tactical experiment had missed success only by a narrow margin and that there was scope for its development but the allied commands missed the true lesson which was that a surprise attack could be successfully made immediately following a short bombardment that compensated for its brevity by its intensity instead they drew the superficial deduction that mere volume of shellfire was the key to reducing a trench line prior to an assault not until 1917 did they revert to the neuvechapelle method it was left to the germans to profit from the experiment in the meantime a french offensive in april against the germans’ saintmihiel salient southeast of verdun sacrificed 64000 men to no effect\\n\\nthe germans in accordance with falkenhayn’s strategy remained generally on the defensive in the west they did however launch an attack on the allies’ ypres salient where the french had in november 1914 taken the place of the british there on april 22 1915 they used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front but they made the mistake of discharging it from cylinders which were dependent on a favourable wind rather than lobbing it onto the enemy trenches in artillery shells the gas did throw the agonized defenders into chaotic flight but the german high command having been disappointed by the new weapon’s performance under adverse conditions in poland earlier in the year had failed to provide adequate reserves to exploit its unforeseen success by the end of a monthlong battle the allies’ front was only slightly retracted\\n\\non may 9 meanwhile the allies had launched yet another premature offensive combining a major french onslaught between lens and arras with two thrusts by haig’s 1st army from festubert and from fromelles against the aubers ridge north of lens the french prolonged their effort until june 18 losing 102000 men without securing any gain the british still short of shells against the germans’ mass of machine guns had suspended their attacks three weeks earlier\\n\\nan even worse military failure was the joint offensive launched by the allies on sept 25 1915 while 27 french divisions with 850 heavy guns attacked on a front 18 miles long in champagne north and east of reims simultaneous blows were delivered in distant artois by 14 french divisions with 420 heavy guns on a 12mile front south of lens and by six british divisions with only 117 guns at loos north of lens all of these attacks were disappointing failures partly because they were preceded by prolonged bombardments that gave away any chance of surprise and allowed time for german reserves to be sent forward to close up the gaps that had been opened in the trench defenders’ ranks by the artillery bombardment at loos the british use of chlorine gas was less effective than haig had hoped and his engagement of all his own available forces for his first assault came to nothing when his commander in chief sir john french was too slow in sending up reserves the french on both their fronts likewise lost through lack of timely support most of what they had won by their first attacks in all for a little ground the allies paid 242000 men against the defenders’ loss of 141000\\n\\nhaving subsequently complained bitterly about sir john french’s management of operations haig was appointed british commander in chief in his place in december\\n\\nthe eastern front 1915\\nthe russians’ plans for 1915 prescribed the strengthening of their flanks in the north and in galicia before driving westward again toward silesia their preparations for a blow at east prussia’s southern frontier were forestalled as ludendorff striking suddenly eastward from east prussia enveloped four russian divisions in the augustów forests east of the masurian lakes in the second week of february but in galicia the winter’s fighting culminated on march 22 in the fall of przemyśl to the russians\\nfor the central powers the austrian spokesman conrad primarily required some action to relieve the pressure on his galician front and falkenhayn was willing to help him for that purpose without departing from his own general strategy of attrition—which was already coming into conflict with ludendorff’s desire for a sustained effort toward decisive victory over russia the plan finally adopted with the aim of smashing the russian centre in the dunajec river sector of galicia by an attack on the 18mile front from gorlice to tuchów south of tarnów was conceived with tactical originality in order to maintain the momentum of advance no daily objectives were to be set for individual corps or divisions instead each should make all possible progress before the russians could bring their reserves up on the assumption that the rapid advance of some attacking units would contagiously promote the subsequent advance of others that had at first met more resistance late in april 14 divisions with 1500 guns were quietly concentrated for the stroke against the six russian divisions present mackensen was in command with hans von seeckt sponsor of the new tactic of infiltration as his chief of staff\\n\\nthe gorlice attack was launched on may 2 and achieved success beyond all expectation routed on the dunajec the russians tried to stand on the wisłoka then fell back again by may 14 mackensen’s forces were on the san 80 miles from their starting point and at jarosław they even forced a crossing of that river strengthened with more german troops from france mackensen then struck again taking przemyśl on june 3 and lemberg lvov on june 22 the russian front was now bisected but falkenhayn and conrad had foreseen no such result and had made no preparations to exploit it promptly their consequent delays enabled the russian armies to retreat without breaking up entirely\\n\\nfalkenhayn then decided to pursue a new offensive mackensen was instructed to veer northward so as to catch the russian armies in the warsaw salient between his forces and hindenburg’s which were to drive southeastward from east prussia ludendorff disliked the plan as being too much of a frontal assault the russians might be squeezed by the closingin of the two wings but their retreat to the east would not be cut off he once more urged his spring scheme for a wide enveloping maneuver through kovno kaunas on vilna vilnius and minsk in the north falkenhayn opposed this plan fearing that it would mean more troops and a deeper commitment and on july 2 the german emperor decided in favour of falkenhayn’s plan\\n\\nthe results justified ludendorff’s reservations the russians held mackensen at brestlitovsk and hindenburg on the narew river long enough to enable the main body of their troops to escape through the unclosed gap to the east though by the end of august all of poland had been occupied and 750000 russians had been taken prisoner in four months of fighting the central powers had missed their opportunity to break russia’s ability to carry on the war\\n\\ntoo late falkenhayn in september allowed ludendorff to try what he had been urging much earlier a wider enveloping movement to the north on the kovno–dvinsk–vilna triangle the german cavalry in fact approached the minsk railway far beyond vilna but the russians’ power of resistance was too great for ludendorff’s slender forces whose supplies moreover began to run out and by the end of the month his operations were suspended the crux of this situation was that the russian armies had been allowed to draw back almost out of the net before the longdelayed vilna maneuver was attempted meanwhile an austrian attack eastward from lutsk luck begun later in september and continued into october incurred heavy losses for no advantage at all by october 1915 the russian retreat after a nervewracking series of escapes from the salients the germans had systematically created and then sought to cut off had come to a definite halt along a line running from the baltic sea just west of riga southward to czernowitz chernovtsy on the romanian borderother fronts 1915–16\\nthe caucasus 1914–16\\nthe caucasian front between russia and turkey comprised two battlegrounds armenia in the west azerbaijan in the east while the ultimate strategic objectives for the turks were to capture the baku oilfields in azerbaijan and to penetrate central asia and afghanistan in order to threaten british india they needed first to capture the armenian fortress of kars which together with that of ardahan had been a russian possession since 1878\\n\\na russian advance from sarıkamış sarykamysh south of kars toward erzurum in turkish armenia in november 1914 was countered in december when the turkish 3rd army under enver himself launched a threepronged offensive against the kars–ardahan position this offensive was catastrophically defeated in battles at sarıkamış and at ardahan in january 1915 but the turks illclad and illsupplied in the caucasian winter lost many more men through exposure and exhaustion than in fighting their 3rd army was reduced in one month from 190000 to 12400 men the battle casualties being 30000 turkish forces which had meanwhile invaded neutral persia’s part of azerbaijan and taken tabriz on january 14 were expelled by a russian counterinvasion in march\\n\\nduring this campaign the armenians had created disturbances behind the turkish lines in support of the russians and had threatened the already arduous turkish communications the turkish government on june 11 1915 decided to deport the armenians in the process of deportation the turkish authorities committed atrocities on a vast scale most estimates of armenian deaths have ranged from 600000 to 1500000 for this period\\n\\ngrand duke nicholas who had hitherto been commander in chief of all russia’s armies was superseded by emperor nicholas himself in september 1915 the grand duke was then sent to command in the caucasus he and general nn yudenich the victor of sarıkamış started a major assault on turkish armenia in january 1916 erzurum was taken on february 16 trabzon on april 18 erzıncan on august 2 and a longdelayed turkish counterattack was held at oğnut stabilized to russia’s great advantage in the autumn the new front in armenia was thereafter affected less by russoturkish warfare than by the consequences of revolution in russia\\n\\nmesopotamia 1914–april 1916\\nthe british occupation of basra turkey’s port at the head of the persian gulf in november 1914 had been justifiable strategically because of the need to protect the oil wells of southern persia and the abadan refinery the british advance of 46 miles northward from basra to alqurnah in december and the further advance of 90 miles up the tigris to alʿamārah in may–june 1915 ought to have been reckoned enough for all practical purposes but the advance was continued in the direction of the fatally magnetic baghdad ancient capital of the arab caliphs of islām alkūt was occupied in september 1915 and the advance was pushed on until the british under major general charles townshend were 500 miles away from their base at basra they fought a profitless battle at ctesiphon only 18 miles from baghdad on november 22 but then had to retreat to alkūt there from december 7 townshend’s 10000 men were besieged by the turks and there on april 29 1916 they surrendered themselves into captivity\\n\\nthe egyptian frontiers 1915–july 1917\\neven after the evacuation from gallipoli the british maintained 250000 troops in egypt a major source of worry to the british was the danger of a turkish threat from palestine across the sinai desert to the suez canal that danger waned however when the initially unpromising rebellion of the hāshimite amir ḥusayn ibn ʿalī against the turks in the hejaz was developed by the personal enterprise of an unprofessional soldier of genius te lawrence into a revolt infecting the whole arabian hinterland of palestine and syria and threatening to sever the turks’ vital hejaz railway damascus–amman–maʿān–medina sir archibald murray’s british troops at last started a massive advance in december 1916 and captured some turkish outposts on the northeastern edge of the sinai desert but made a pusillanimous withdrawal from gaza in march 1917 at the very moment when the turks were about to surrender the place to them the attempt the next month to retrieve the mistake was repulsed with heavy losses in june the command was transferred from murray to sir edmund allenby in striking contrast to murray’s performance was lawrence’s capture of aqaba alʿaqabah on july 6 1917 his handful of arabs got the better of 1200 turks there\\n\\nlearn more\\nitaly and the italian front 1915–16\\ngreat britain france and russia concluded on april 26 1915 the secret treaty of london with italy inducing the latter to discard the obligations of the triple alliance and to enter the war on the side of the allies by the promise of territorial aggrandizement at austriahungary’s expense italy was offered not only the italianpopulated trentino and trieste but also south tirol to consolidate the alpine frontier gorizia istria and northern dalmatia on may 23 1915 italy accordingly declared war on austriahungary\\n\\nthe italian commander general luigi cadorna decided to concentrate his effort on an offensive eastward from the province of venetia across the comparatively low ground between the head of the adriatic and the foothills of the julian alps that is to say across the lower valley of the isonzo soc̆a river against the risk of an austrian descent on his rear from the trentino which bordered venetia to the northwest or on his left flank from the carnic alps to the north he thought that limited advances would be precaution enough\\n\\nthe italians’ initial advance eastward begun late in may 1915 was soon halted largely because of the flooding of the isonzo and trench warfare set in cadorna however was determined to make progress and so embarked on a series of persistent renewals of the offensive known as the battles of the isonzo the first four of these june 23–july 7 july 18–august 3 october 18–november 4 and november 10–december 2 achieved nothing worth the cost of 280000 men and the fifth march 1916 was equally fruitless the austrians had shown on this front a fierce resolution that was often lacking when they faced the russians in midmay 1916 cadorna’s program was interrupted by an austrian offensive from the trentino into the asiago region of western venetia though the danger of an austrian breakthrough from the mountainous borderland into the venetian plain in the rear of the italians’ isonzo front was averted the italian counteroffensive in midjune recovered only onethird of the territory overrun by the austrians north and southwest of asiago the sixth battle of the isonzo august 6–17 however did win gorizia for the italians on august 28 italy declared war on germany the next three months saw three more italian offensives on the isonzo none of them really profitable in the course of 1916 the italians had sustained 500000 casualties twice as many as the austrians and were still on the isonzo\\n\\nserbia and the salonika expedition 1915–17\\naustria’s three attempted invasions of serbia in 1914 had been brusquely repulsed by serbian counterattacks by the summer of 1915 the central powers were doubly concerned to close the account with serbia both for reasons of prestige and for the sake of establishing secure rail communications with turkey across the balkans in august germany sent reinforcements to austria’s southern front and on sept 6 1915 the central powers concluded a treaty with bulgaria whom they drew to their side by the offer of territory to be taken from serbia the austrogerman forces attacked southward from the danube on october 6 and the bulgars undeterred by a russian ultimatum struck at eastern serbia on october 11 and at serbian macedonia on october 14\\n\\nthe western allies surprised in september by the prospect of a bulgarian attack on serbia hastily decided to send help through neutral greece’s macedonian port of salonika relying on the collusion of greece’s proentente prime minister eleuthérios venizélos troops from gallipoli under the french general maurice sarrail reached salonika on october 5 but on that day venizélos fell from power the allies advanced northward up the vardar into serbian macedonia but found themselves prevented from junction with the serbs by the westward thrust of the bulgars driven back over the greek frontier the allies were merely occupying the salonika region by middecember the serbian army meanwhile to avoid double envelopment had begun an arduous winter retreat westward over the albanian mountains to refuge on the island of corfu\\n\\n\\nin the spring of 1916 the allies at salonika were reinforced by the revived serbs from corfu as well as by french british and some russian troops and the bridgehead was expanded westward to vodena edessa and eastward to kilkis but the bulgars who in may obtained fort rupel klidhi on the struma from the greeks in midaugust not only overran greek macedonia east of the struma but also from monastir bitola invaded the florina region of greek macedonia to the west of the allies’ vodena wing the allied counteroffensive took monastir from the bulgars in november 1916 but more ambitious operations from march to may 1917 proved abortive the salonika front was tying

wheat specimens at university college london’s petrie museum of egyptian archaeology from a 2018 bbc documentary richard mott of the ucl genetics institute wanted to study them the samples likely contained bits of ancient wheat dna he reasoned which could yield valuable insights into the history of cultivation of this allimportant crop species\\n\\narchaeobotanists at ucl helped mott and a team of collaborators choose a handful of wellpreserved husks from the museum’s collection of ancient emmer wheat a variety native to the near east and one of the first crops to be domesticated in the region from which the researchers selected two husks for dna extraction after carefully removing the husks from the box photographing them and wrapping them in foil the scientists transported the centuriesold plant material to a freshly bleached cleanroom used exclusively to process ancient and forensic samples \\nthere team member laura botigué a population geneticist and visiting researcher from the centre for research in agricultural genomics crag in barcelona spain donned a hairnet two tyvek suits two pairs of latex gloves and a mask—part of a protocol designed to avoid contaminating the samples with her own cells uncertain how the delicate husks would hold up to the standard decontamination protocol of bleaching the samples botigué bleached one and left the second untouched then to lyse the plant’s cells she put the samples in a rotator that gently shook the husks inside an oven over the next several days finally she used a centrifugation protocol to separate any dna from the degraded cell walls and proteins\\n\\nonce the samples had been prepped and delivered to the ucl genomics facility for sequencing it was a waiting game to see if the procedure had yielded any readable wheat dna “this is the more stressful part” botigué says because they lack the type of protective collagen matrix found in bones plants don’t preserve ancient dna as well as animals “you finish the dna is theoretically extracted but you don’t see it in the tube” says botigué “you’re in the blind until you hear back from the sequencing services” \\n\\nwithin just a few weeks the team got good news for the husk that botigué had bleached about twothirds of the reads aligned with genomes of modern wild and domesticated emmer wheat varieties—a relatively good success rate for ancient dna according to evolutionary geneticist michael scott a postdoc in mott’s lab who conducted the bioinformatics analysis of the sequences “the first surprise was how well it worked” he says “it appears that the dry conditions in egypt were good for dna preservation” the unbleached husk had yielded a smaller quantity of sequences but those fragments mostly matched the ones in the bleached sample validating the identity of those sequences as coming from the ancient wheat samples rather than from contaminants\\nthe museum wheat which carbon dating showed was from between 1130 and 1000 bc was genetically much more similar to modern domesticated varieties than to modern wild ones suggesting that the plant lineage the samples came from had already been domesticated specifically the sequences most resembled those of modern domesticated strains grown in turkey oman and india there was also evidence for genetic exchange between the museum wheat strain and the wild emmer wheat that grew in the levant a large region in the eastern mediterranean that was a center of agricultural development in the neolithic period and where emmer was first cultivated the genetic exchange could have occurred before the wheat’s introduction to egypt from the levant says scott alternatively it’s possible that the ancient egyptians’ wheat was able to interbreed with wild wheat in the southern levant thanks to interactions between the people in the two regions \\n“with big data and with a really good analysis method they were able to detect this gene flow” says m timothy rabanuswallace an agricultural geneticist at the leibniz institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in germany who coauthored a perspective published alongside the study in nature plants last october “it’s fascinating to see this gene flow happening    in an area important for human history” \\n\\nsee “confessing to plant blindness”\\nthe bioinformatics analysis also uncovered some genetic variants in the ancient samples that weren’t found in any of the modern emmer wheat genomes the researchers studied if these variants helped the wheat survive in arid locations around the near east perhaps introducing those sequences into modern varieties could help make them more sustainable or more drought resistant scott says though he admits that this “is very much just an idea” \\nthe detection of ancient genetic variation is a notable achievement because wheat genomes are large—three to five times the length of a human genome—and repetitive making the “analysis    incredibly complex” says james breen head of the bioinformatics core at the south australian health and medical research institute who reviewed the study and coauthored the perspective with rabanuswallace a phd student in his lab at the australian centre for ancient dna at the time “so being able to find unique pieces of dna in that genome is very difficult” he adds that after a couple of additional validation tests performed by the ucl team he was convinced that “the data that came out was legitimately ancient”\\n\\nbotigué and scott emphasize that the study is primarily a proof of concept that museumkept plant samples can yield readable genetic material “we were able to look at dna from specimens that had been stored in the museum for over 90 years without special preservation conditions—the museum was actually even bombed and flooded during wartime” says scott “we think our study helps demonstrate the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data which”—in combination with new samples—“can be used to uncover the history of selection on crops and their movement around the globe” \\n\\nsee “the narluga new insights from old bones”\\n“i think that’s one of the biggest values of ancient dna in plants” adds nathan wales an archaeologist at the university of york who was not involved in scott and botigué’s study—“to draw connections between different cultures and the different agricultural products they were growing and trading and seeing how that changed over time” major developments in 1916\\nthe western front 1916\\nin 1914 the centre of gravity of world war i had been on the western front in 1915 it shifted to the eastern and in 1916 it once more moved back to france though the western allies had dissipated some of their strength in the dardanelles salonika and mesopotamia the rising tide of britain’s new armies and of its increased munition supplies promised the means for an offensive far larger in scale than any before to break the trench deadlock britain’s armies in france had grown to 36 divisions by the end of 1915 by that time voluntary enlistments though massive had nevertheless proved to be inadequate to meet britain’s needs so in january 1916 by the military service act voluntary service was replaced by conscription\\n\\nin december 1915 a conference of the leaders of the french british belgian and italian armies with representatives present from the russian and japanese armies was held at joffre’s headquarters they adopted the principle of a simultaneous general offensive in 1916 by france great britain russia and italy but military action by germany was to dislocate this scheme and only the british offensive came fully into operation\\nby the winter of 1915–16 falkenhayn regarded russia as paralyzed and italy as inconsiderable he considered the time at last ripe for positive action against france after whose collapse great britain would have no effective military ally on the european continent and would be brought to terms rather by submarine warfare than by land operations for his offensive in the west however falkenhayn clung always to his method of attrition he believed that a mass breakthrough was unnecessary and that instead the germans should aim to bleed france of its manpower by choosing a point of attack “for the retention of which the french command would be compelled to throw in every man they have” the town of verdun and its surrounding complex of forts was chosen because it was a menace to the main german lines of communications because it was within a french salient and thus cramped the defenders and because of the certainty that the french would sacrifice any number of men to defend verdun for reasons of patriotism associated with the town itself\\n\\nthe keynote of falkenhayn’s tactical plan was to place a dense semicircle of german heavy and medium artillery to the north and east of verdun and its outlying fortresses and then to stage a continuous series of limited infantry advances upon the forts these advances would draw the french infantry into defending or trying to retake the forts in the process of which they would be pulverized by german artillery fire in addition each german infantry advance would have its way smoothed by a brief but extremely intense artillery bombardment that would clear the targeted ground of defenders\\n\\nalthough french intelligence had given early warnings of the germans’ offensive preparations the french high command was so preoccupied with its own projected offensive scheme that the warning fell on deaf ears at 715 am on feb 21 1916 the heaviest german artillery bombardment yet seen in the war began on a front of eight miles around verdun and the french trenches and barbed wire fields there were flattened out or upheaved in a chaos of tumbled earth at 445 pm the german infantry advanced—although for the first day only on a front of two and a half miles from then until february 24 the french defenders’ lines east of the meuse river crumbled away fortdouaumont one of the most important fortresses was occupied by the germans on february 25 by march 6 when the germans began to attack on the west bank of the meuse as well as on the east bank the french had come to see that something more than a feint was intended to relieve the pressure on france the russians made a sacrificial attack on the eastern front at lake naroch see below the eastern front 1916 the italians began their fifth offensive on the isonzo see above italy and the italian front 1915–16 and the british took over the arras sector of the western front thus becoming responsible for the whole line from the yser southward to the somme meanwhile general philippe pétain was entrusted with commanding the defense of verdun he organized repeated counterattacks that slowed the german advance and more importantly he worked to keep open the one road leading into verdun that had not been closed by german shelling this was the barleduc road which became known as la voie sacrée the “sacred way” because vital supplies and reinforcements continued to be sent to the verdun front along it despite constant harassment from the german artillery\\nslowly but steadily the germans moved forward on verdun they took fortvaux southeast of fortdouaumont on june 7 and almost reached the belleville heights the last stronghold before verdun itself on june 23 pétain was preparing to evacuate the east bank of the meuse when the allies’ offensive on the somme river was at last launched thereafter the germans assigned no more divisions to the verdun attack\\n\\npreceded by a week’s bombardment which gave ample warning of its advent the somme offensive was begun on july 1 1916 by the 11 british divisions of rawlinson’s new 4th army on a 15mile front between serre north of the ancre and curlu north of the somme while five french divisions attacked at the same time on an eightmile front mainly south of the somme between curlu and péronne with incredibly misplaced optimism haig had convinced himself that the british infantry would be able to walk forward irresistibly over ground cleared of defenders by the artillery but the unconcealed preparations for the assault and the long preliminary bombardment had given away any chance of surprise and the german defenders were well prepared for what was to come in the event the 60000 attacking british infantrymen moving forward in symmetrical alignment at a snail’s pace enforced by each man’s 66 pounds 30 kilograms of cumbrous equipment were mowed down in masses by the german machine guns and the day’s casualties were the heaviest ever sustained by a british army the french participants in the attack had twice as many guns as the british and did better against a weaker system of defenses but almost nothing could be done to exploit this comparative success\\n\\nresigning himself now to limited advances haig concentrated his next effort on the southern sector of his somme front the germans’ second position there longueval bazentin and ovillers fell on july 14 but again the opportunity of exploitation was missed thenceforward at great cost in lives a methodical advance was continued gaining little ground but straining the german resistance the first tanks to be used in the war though in numbers far too small to be effective were thrown into the battle by the british on september 15 in midnovember early rains halted operations the fourmonth battle of the somme was a miserable failure except that it diverted german resources from the attack on verdun it cost the british 420000 casualties the french 195000 and the germans 650000\\n\\nat verdun the summer slackening of german pressure enabled the french to organize counterattacks surprise attacks directed by general robertgeorges nivelle and launched by general charles mangin’s army corps recovered fortdouaumont on october 24 fortvaux on november 2 and places north of douaumont in middecember pétain’s adroit defense of verdun and these counterattacks had deprived falkenhayn’s offensive of its strategic fulfillment but france had been so much weakened in the first half of 1916 that it could scarcely satisfy the allies’ expectations in the second verdun was one of the longest bloodiest and most ferocious battles of the war french casualties amounted to about 400000 german ones to about 350000the battle of jutland\\nthe summer of 1916 saw the longdeferred confrontation of germany’s high seas fleet and great britain’s grand fleet in the battle of jutland—history’s biggest naval battle which both sides claimed as a victory\\n\\nadmiral reinhard scheer who became commander in chief of the high seas fleet in january 1916 planned to contrive an encounter on the open sea between his fleet and some part of the british fleet in separation from the whole so that the germans could exploit their momentary superiority in numbers to achieve victory scheer’s plan was to ensnare admiral beatty’s squadron of battle cruisers at rosyth midway up britain’s eastern coast by stratagem and destroy it before any reinforcements from the grand fleet’s main base at scapa flow could reach it\\n\\nto set the trap five battle cruisers of the german high seas fleet together with four light cruisers were to sail northward under hipper’s command from wilhelmshaven ger to a point off the southwestern coast of norway scheer himself with the battle squadrons of the high seas fleet was to follow 50 miles behind to catch beatty’s forces in the gap once they had been lured eastward across the north sea in pursuit of hipper but the signal for the german operation to begin made in the afternoon of may 30 was intercepted and partially decoded by the british and before midnight the whole british grand fleet was on its way to a rendezvous off norway’s southwestern coast and roughly across the planned route of the german fleet\\n\\nat 220 pm on may 31 when admiral john jellicoe’s grand fleet squadrons from scapa flow were still 65 miles away to the north beatty’s advance guard of light cruisers—five miles ahead of his heavier ships—and hipper’s scouting group learned quite accidentally of one another’s proximity an hour later the two lines were drawn up for battle and in the next 50 minutes the british suffered severely and the indefatigable was sunk when beatty’s battle cruisers came up however the german cruisers in their turn sustained such damage that hipper sent a protective screen of german destroyers in to launch a torpedo attack the british had lost another battle cruiser the queen mary before the german high seas fleet was sighted by a british patrol to the south at 435 pm on this report beatty ordered his ships northward to lure the germans toward the grand fleet under jellicoe’s command\\n\\nnot until 614 pm after jellicoe’s squadrons and beatty’s had been within sight of one another for nearly a quarter of an hour was the german fleet precisely located—only just in time for jellicoe to deploy his ships to the best advantage jellicoe arrayed the grand fleet endtoend in a line so that their combined broadsides could be brought to bear on the approaching german ships who could in turn reply only with the forward guns of their leading ships the british ships in effect formed the horizontal stroke and the german ships the vertical stroke of the letter “t” with the british having deployed into line at a right angle to the german ships’ forward progress this maneuver was in fact known as “crossing the enemy’s t” and was the ideal situation dreamed of by the tacticians of both navies since by “crossing the t” one’s forces temporarily gained an overwhelming superiority of firepower\\n\\nfor the germans this was a moment of unparalleled risk three factors helped prevent the destruction of the german ships in this trap their own excellent construction the steadiness and discipline of their crews and the poor quality of the british shells the lützow the derfflinger and the battleship könig led the line and were under broadside fire from some 10 british battleships yet their main guns remained undamaged and they fought back to such effect that one of their salvoes fell full on the invincible and blew it up this success however did little to relieve the intense bombardment from the other british ships and the german fleet was still pressing forward into the steel trap of the grand fleet\\n\\nrelying on the magnificent seamanship of the german crews scheer extricated his fleet from the appalling danger into which it had run by a simple but in practice extremely difficult maneuver at 630 pm he ordered a turn of 180° for all his ships at once it was executed without collision and the german battleships reversed course in unison and steamed out of the jaws of the trap while german destroyers spread a smoke screen across their rear the smoke and worsening visibility left jellicoe in doubt about what had happened and the british had lost contact with the germans by 645 pm\\n\\nyet the british grand fleet had maneuvered in such a way that it ended up between the german high seas fleet and the german ports and this was the situation scheer most dreaded so at 655 pm scheer ordered another reverse turn perhaps hoping to pass around the rear of the british fleet but the result for him was a worse position than that from which he had just escaped his battle line had become compressed and his leading ships found themselves again under intense bombardment from the broadside array of the british ships jellicoe had succeeded in crossing the germans’ “t” again the lützow now received irreparable damage and many other german ships were damaged at this point at 715 pm therefore to cause a diversion and win time scheer ordered his battle cruisers and destroyers ahead to virtually immolate themselves in a massed charge against the british ships\\n\\nthis was the crisis of the battle of jutland as the german battle cruisers and destroyers steamed forward the german battleships astern became confused and disorganized in trying to execute their reverse turn had jellicoe ordered the grand fleet forward through the screen of charging german battle cruisers at that moment the fate of the german high seas fleet would likely have been sealed as it was fearing and overestimating the danger of torpedo attacks from the approaching destroyers he ordered his fleet to turn away and the two lines of battleships steamed apart at a speed of more than 20 knots they did not meet again and when darkness fell jellicoe could not be sure of the route of the german retreat by 300 am on june 1 the germans had safely eluded their pursuers\\n\\nthe british had sustained greater losses than the germans in both ships and men in all the british lost three battle cruisers three cruisers eight destroyers and 6274 officers and men in the battle of jutland the germans lost one battleship one battle cruiser four light cruisers five destroyers and 2545 officers and men the losses inflicted on the british however were not enough to affect the numerical superiority of their fleet over the german in the north sea where their domination remained practically unchallengeable during the course of the war henceforth the german high seas fleet chose not to venture out from the safety of its home ports\\n\\nlearn more\\nthe eastern front 1916\\nin the hope of diverting german strength from the attack at verdun on the western front the russians gallantly but prematurely opened an offensive north and south of lake naroch narocz east of vilna on march 18 1916 and continued it until march 27 though they won very little ground at great cost and only for a short time they then reverted to preparations for a major offensive in july the main blow it was planned should be delivered by ae evert’s central group of armies assisted by an inward movement of an kuropatkin’s army in the northern sector of the front but at the same time aa brusilov’s southwestern army group was authorized to make a supposedly diversionary attack in its own sectors in the event brusilov’s attack became by far the more important operation of the offensive\\n\\nsurprised by the austrians’ asiago offensive in may italy promptly appealed to the russians for action to draw the enemy’s reserves away from the italian fronts and the russians responded by advancing their timetable again brusilov undertook to start his attack on june 4 on the understanding that evert’s should be launched 10 days later\\n\\nthus began an offensive on the eastern front that was to be imperial russia’s last really effective military effort popularly known as brusilov’s offensive it had such an astonishing initial success as to revive allied dreams about the irresistible russian “steamroller” instead its ultimate achievement was to sound the death knell of the russian monarchy brusilov’s four armies were distributed along a very wide front with lutsk at the northern end tarnopol and buchach buczacz in the central sector and czernowitz at the southern end having struck first in the tarnopol and czernowitz sectors on june 4 brusilov on june 5 took the austrians wholly by surprise when he launched am kaledin’s army toward lutsk the defenses crumbled at once and the attackers pushed their way between two austrian armies as the offensive was developed the russians were equally successful in the buchach sector and in their thrust into bukovina which culminated in the capture of czernowitz by june 20 brusilov’s forces had captured 200000 prisoners\\n\\nevert and kuropatkin however instead of striking in accordance with the agreed plan found excuses for procrastination the russian chief of general staff mv alekseyev therefore tried to transfer this inert couple’s reserves to brusilov but the russians’ lateral communications were so poor that the germans had time to reinforce the austrians before brusilov was strong enough to make the most of his victory though his forces in bukovina advanced as far as the carpathian mountains a counterstroke by alexander von linsingen’s germans in the lutsk sector checked russian progress at the decisive point further russian drives from the centre of brusilov’s front were launched in july but by early september the opportunity of exploiting the summer’s victory was lost brusilov had driven the austrians from bukovina and from much of eastern galicia and had inflicted huge losses of men and equipment on them but he had depleted russia’s armies by about 1000000 men in doing so a large portion of this number consisted of deserters or prisoners this loss seriously undermined both the morale and the material strength of russia brusilov’s offensive also had indirect results of great consequence first it had compelled the germans to withdraw at least seven divisions from the western front where they could ill be spared from the verdun and somme battles second it hastened romania’s unfortunate entry into the war\\n\\ndisregarding romania’s military backwardness the romanian government of ionel brătianu declared war against austriahungary on aug 27 1916 in entering the war romania succumbed to the allies’ offers of austrohungarian territory and to the belief that the central powers would be too much preoccupied with other fronts to mount any serious riposte against a romanian offensive some 12 of romania’s 23 divisions in three columns thus began on august 28 a slow westward advance across transylvania where at first there were only five austrohungarian divisions to oppose them\\n\\nthe riposte of the central powers was swifter than the progress of the invasion germany turkey and bulgaria declared war against romania on august 28 august 30 and september 1 respectively and falkenhayn had plans already prepared though the miscarriage of his overall program for the year led to his being replaced by hindenburg as chief of the german general staff on august 29 falkenhayn’s recommendation that mackensen should direct a bulgarian attack on southern romania was approved and falkenhayn himself went to command on the transylvanian front for which five german as well as two more austrian divisions were found available as reinforcements\\n\\nmackensen’s forces from bulgaria stormed the turtucaia tutrakan bridgehead on the danube southeast of bucharest on september 5 his subsequent advance eastward into the dobruja caused the romanians to switch their reserves to that quarter instead of reinforcing their transylvanian enterprise which thereupon came to a halt falkenhayn soon attacked first at the southern end of the 200mile front where he threw one of the romanian columns back into the roter turm turnu roşu pass then in the centre where by october 9 he had defeated another at kronstadt braşov for a month however the romanians withstood falkenhayn’s attempts to drive them out of the vulcan and szurduk surduc passes into walachia but just before winter snows blocked the way the germans took the two passes and advanced southward to tîrgu jiu where they won another victory then mackensen having turned westward from the dobruja crossed the danube near bucharest on which his and falkenhayn’s armies converged bucharest fell on december 6 and the romanian army a crippled force could only fall back northeastward into moldavia where it had the belated support of russian troops the central powers had access to romania’s wheat fields and oil wells and the russians had 300 more miles of front to defend\\ngerman strategy and the submarine war 1916–january 1917\\nboth admiral scheer and general falkenhayn doubted whether the german submarines could do any decisive damage to great britain so long as their warfare was restricted in deference to the protests of the united states and after a tentative reopening of the submarine campaign on feb 4 1916 the german naval authorities in march gave the uboats permission to sink without warning all ships except passenger vessels the german civilian statesmen however who paid due attention to their diplomats’ warnings about us opinion were soon able to prevail over the generals and the admirals on may 4 the scope of the submarine campaign was again severely restricted\\n\\nthe controversy between the statesmen and the advocates of unrestricted warfare was not dead yet hindenburg chief of the general staff from august 29 had ludendorff as his quartermaster general and ludendorff was quickly won over to supporting the chief of the admiralty staff henning von holtzendorff in his arguments against the german chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg and the foreign minister gottlieb von jagow whereas bethmann and some other statesmen were hoping for a negotiated peace see below hindenburg and ludendorff were committed to a military victory the british naval blockade however threatened to starve germany into collapse before a military victory could be achieved and soon hindenburg and ludendorff got their way it was decided that from feb 1 1917 submarine warfare should be unrestricted and overtly so\\n\\nthe final offensive on the western front\\nit was eventually agreed among the allied commanders that pershing’s american troops should advance across the difficult terrain of the argonne forest so that the combined allied offensive would consist of converging attacks against the whole german position west of a line drawn from ypres to verdun thus the americans from the front northwest of verdun and the french from eastern champagne the former on the west bank of the meuse the latter west of the argonne forest were to launch attacks on september 26 with mézières as their objective in order to threaten not only the germans’ supply line along the mézières–sedan–montmédy railway and the natural line of retreat across lorraine but also the hinge of the antwerp–meuse defensive line that the germans were now preparing the british were to attack the hindenburg line between cambrai and saintquentin on september 27 and to try to reach the key rail junction of maubeuge so as to threaten the germans’ line of retreat through the liège gap the belgians with allied support were to begin a drive from ypres toward ghent on september 28\\n\\nthe americans took vauquois and montfaucon in the first two days of their offensive but were soon slowed down and on october 14 when their attack was suspended they had only reached grandpré less than halfway to mézières the french advance meanwhile was halted on the aisne the british though they had broken through the german defenses by october 5 and thenceforward had open country in front of them could not pursue the germans fast enough to endanger their withdrawal nevertheless the piercing of the hindenburg line unnerved the german supreme command the belgians were in possession of all the heights around ypres by september 30\\n\\n\\nthe end of the german war\\ngeorg von hertling who had taken the place of michaelis as germany’s chancellor in november 1917 but had proved no more capable than he of restraining ludendorff and hindenburg tendered his resignation on sept 29 1918 the day of the bulgarian armistice and of the major development of the british attack on the western front pending the appointment of a new chancellor ludendorff and hindenburg obtained the emperor’s consent to an immediate peace move on october 1 they even disclosed their despondency to a meeting of the leaders of all the national political parties thus undermining the german home front by a sudden revelation of facts long hidden from the public and its civilian leaders this new and bleak honesty about germany’s deteriorating military situation gave an immense impetus to the native german forces of pacifism and internal discord on october 3 the new chancellor was appointed he was prince maximilian of baden internationally known for his moderation and honorability though max demanded a few days’ interval lest germany’s overture for peace should appear too obviously an admission of imminent collapse the military leaders insisted on an immediate move a german note to wilson requesting an armistice and negotiations on the basis of wilson’s own pronouncements was sent off in the night of october 3–4\\n\\nthe us answer of october 8 required germany’s preliminary assent 1 to negotiations on the sole question of the means of putting wilson’s principles into practice and 2 to the withdrawal of german forces from allied soil the german government’s note of october 12 accepted these requirements and suggested a mixed commission to arrange the postulated evacuation on october 14 however the us government sent a second note which coupled allusions to germany’s “illegal and inhuman” methods of warfare with demands that the conditions of the armistice and of the evacuation be determined unilaterally by its own and the allies’ military advisers and that the “arbitrary power” of the german regime be removed in order that the forthcoming negotiations could be conducted with a government representative of the german people\\n\\nby this time the german supreme command had become more cheerful even optimistic as it saw that the piercing of the hindenburg line had not been followed by an actual allied breakthrough more encouragement came from reports of a slackening in the force of the allies’ attacks largely because they had advanced too far ahead of their supply lines ludendorff still wanted an armistice but only to give his troops a rest as a prelude to further resistance and to ensure a secure withdrawal to a shortened defensive line on the frontier by october 17 he even felt that his troops could do without a rest it was less that the situation had changed than that his impression of it had been revised it had never been quite so bad as he had pictured it on september 29 but his dismal first impression had now spread throughout german political circles and the public though they had endured increasing privations and were halfstarved due to the allied blockade by mid1918 the german people had retained their morale surprisingly well as long as they believed germany had a prospect of achieving victory on the western front when this hope collapsed in october 1918 many and perhaps even most germans wished only that the war would end though it might mean their nation would have to accept unfavourable peace terms german public opinion having been more suddenly disillusioned was now far more radically defeatist than the supreme command\\n\\na third german note to the united states sent on october 20 agreed to the unilateral settlement of conditions for the armistice and for the evacuation in the express belief that wilson would allow no affront to germany’s honour the answering us note of october 23 conceded wilson’s readiness to propose an armistice to the allies but added that the terms must be such as to make germany incapable of renewing hostilities ludendorff saw this militarily as a demand for unconditional surrender and would therefore have continued resistance but the situation had passed beyond his control and on october 26 he was made to resign by the emperor on prince max’s advice on october 27 germany acknowledged the us note\\n\\nwilson now began to persuade the allies to agree to an armistice and negotiations according to the us–german correspondence they agreed with two reservations they would not subscribe to the second of the fourteen points on the freedom of the seas and they wanted “compensation…for damage done to the civilian population…and their property by the aggression of germany” wilson’s note of november 5 apprised the germans of these reservations and stated that foch would communicate armistice terms to germany’s accredited representatives on november 8 a german delegation led by matthias erzberger arrived at rethondes in the forest of compiègne where the germans met face to face with foch and his party and were informed of the allies’ peace terms\\nmeanwhile revolution was shaking germany it began with a sailors’ mutiny at kiel on october 29 in reaction to the naval command’s order for the high seas fleet to go out into the north sea for a conclusive battle though the uboat crews remained loyal the mutiny of the surfaceship crews spread to other units of the fleet developed into armed insurrection on november 3 and progressed to open revolution the next day there were disturbances in hamburg and in bremen “councils of soldiers and workers” like the russian soviets were formed in inland industrial centres and in the night of november 7–8 a “democratic and socialist republic of bavaria” was proclaimed the social democrats of the reichstag withdrew their support from prince max’s government in order to be free to contend against the communists for the leadership of the revolution while william ii at spa was still wondering whether he could abdicate his imperial german title but remain king of prussia prince max in berlin on november 9 on his own initiative announced william’s abdication of both titles the hohenzollern monarchy thus came to an end joining those of the habsburgs and the romanovs prince max handed his powers as chancellor over to friedrich ebert a majority social democrat who formed a provisional government a member of this government philipp scheidemann hastily proclaimed a republic on november 10 william ii took refuge in the neutral netherlands where on november 28 he signed his own abdication of his sovereign rights\\n\\nthe armistice\\nthe allies’ armistice terms presented in the railway carriage at rethondes were stiff germany was required to evacuate not only belgium france and alsacelorraine but also all the rest of the left west bank of the rhine and it had to neutralize that river’s right bank between the netherlands and switzerland the german troops in east africa were to surrender the german armies in eastern europe were to withdraw to the prewar german frontier the treaties of brestlitovsk and bucharest were to be annulled and the germans were to repatriate all prisoners of war and hand over to the allies a large quantity of war materials including 5000 pieces of artillery 25000 machine guns 1700 aircraft 5000 locomotives and 150000 railroad cars and meanwhile the allies’ blockade of germany was to continue\\npleading the danger of bolshevism in a nation on the verge of collapse the german delegation obtained some mitigation of these terms a suggestion that the blockade might be relaxed a reduction in the quantity of armaments to be handed over and permission for the german forces in eastern europe to stay put for the time being the germans might have held out longer for further concessions if the fact of revolution on their home front had not been coupled with the imminence of a new blow from the west\\n\\nthough the allied advance was continuing and seemed in some sectors even to be accelerating the main german forces had managed to retreat ahead of it the germans’ destruction of roads and railways along the routes of their evacuation made it impossible for supplies to keep pace with the advancing allied troops a pause in the advance would occur while allied communications were being repaired and that would give the germans a breathing space in which to rally their resistance by november 11 the allied advance on the northern sectors of the front had come more or less to a standstill on a line running from pontàmousson through sedan mézières and mons to ghent foch however now had a francous force of 28 divisions and 600 tanks in the south ready to strike through metz into northeastern lorraine since foch’s general offensive had absorbed the germans’ reserves this new offensive would fall on their bared left flank and held the promise of outflanking their whole new line of defense from antwerp to the line of the meuse and of intercepting any german retreat by this time the number of us divisions in france had risen to 42 in addition the british were about to bomb berlin on a scale hitherto unattempted in air warfare\\nwhether the allies’ projected final offensive intended for november 14 would have achieved a breakthrough can never be known at 500 am on nov 11 1918 the armistice document was signed in foch’s railway carriage at rethondes at 1100 am on the same day world war i came to an end\\nthe fact that matthias erzberger who was a civilian politician rather than a soldier headed the german armistice delegation became an integral part of the legend of the “stab in the back” dolchstoss im rücken this legend’s theme was that the german army was “undefeated in the field” unbesiegt im felde and had been “stabbed in the back”—ie had been denied support at the crucial moment by a weary and defeatist civilian population and their leaders this theme was adopted soon after the war’s end by ludendorff himself and by other german generals who were unwilling to admit the hopelessness of germany’s military situation in november 1918 and who wanted to vindicate the honour of german arms the “stab in the back” legend soon found its way into german historiography and was picked up by german rightwing political agitators who claimed that allied propaganda in germany in the last stages of the war had undermined civilian morale and that traitors among the politicians had been at hand ready to do the allies’ bidding by signing the armistice adolf hitler eventually became the foremost of these political agitators branding erzberger and the leaders of the social democrats as the “november criminals” and advocating militaristic and expansionist policies by which germany could redeem its defeat in the war gain vengeance upon its enemies and become the preeminent power in europe\\n\\nlearn more\\nkilled wounded and missing\\nthe casualties suffered by the participants in world war i dwarfed those of previous wars some 8500000 soldiers died as a result of wounds andor disease the greatest number of casualties and wounds were inflicted by artillery followed by small arms and then by poison gas the bayonet which was relied on by the prewar french army as the decisive weapon actually produced few casualties war was increasingly mechanized from 1914 and produced casualties even when nothing important was happening on even a quiet day on the western front many hundreds of allied and german soldiers died the heaviest loss of life for a single day occurred on july 1 1916 during the battle of the somme when the british army suffered 57470 casualties\\n\\nsir winston churchill once described the battles of the somme and verdun which were typical of trench warfare in their futile and indiscriminate slaughter as being waged between double or triple walls of cannons fed by mountains of shells in an open space surrounded by masses of these guns large numbers of infantry divisions collided they fought in this dangerous position until battered into a state of uselessness then they were replaced by other divisions so many men were lost in the process and shattered beyond recognition that there is a french monument at verdun to the 150000 unlocated dead who are assumed to be buried in the vicinity\\n\\nthis kind of war made it difficult to prepare accurate casualty lists there were revolutions in four of the warring countries in 1918 and the attention of the new governments was shifted away from the grim problem of war losses a completely accurate table of losses may never be compiled the best available estimates of world war i military casualties are assembled in table 4\\nsimilar uncertainties exist about the number of civilian deaths attributable to the war there were no agencies established to keep records of these fatalities but it is clear that the displacement of peoples through the movement of the war in europe and in asia minor accompanied as it was in 1918 by the most destructive outbreak of influenza in history led to the deaths of large numbers it has been estimated that the number of civilian deaths attributable to the war was higher than the military casualties or around 13000000 these civilian deaths were largely caused by starvation exposure disease military encounters and massacresthe

ambitions of world domination hitler’s invasion of poland in september 1939 drove great britain and france to declare war on germany and world war ii had begun over the next six years the conflict

alliances with italy and japan against the soviet union hitler sent troops to occupy austria in 1938 and the following year annexed czechoslovakia hitler’s open aggression went unchecked as the united

the eastern twothirds being taken over by the ussr\\n\\nhaving achieved this cynical agreement the other provisions of which stupefied europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol hitler thought that germany could attack poland with no danger of soviet or british intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on august 26 news of the signing on august 25 of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between great britain and poland to supersede a previous though temporary agreement caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days he was still determined however to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him finally at 1240 pm on august 31 1939 hitler ordered hostilities against poland to start at 445 the next morning the invasion began as ordered in response great britain and france declared war on germany on september 3 at 1100 am and at 500 pm respectively world war ii had begunforces and resources of the european combatants 1939\\nin september 1939 the allies namely great britain france and poland were together superior in industrial resources population and military manpower but the german army or wehrmacht because of its armament training doctrine discipline and fighting spirit was the most efficient and effective fighting force for its size in the world the index of military strength in september 1939 was the number of divisions that each nation could mobilize against germany’s 100 infantry divisions and six armoured divisions france had 90 infantry divisions in metropolitan france great britain had 10 infantry divisions and poland had 30 infantry divisions 12 cavalry brigades and one armoured brigade poland had also 30 reserve infantry divisions but these could not be mobilized quickly a division contained from 12000 to 25000 men\\n\\nit was the qualitative superiority of the german infantry divisions and the number of their armoured divisions that made the difference in 1939 the firepower of a german infantry division far exceeded that of a french british or polish division the standard german division included 442 machine guns 135 mortars 72 antitank guns and 24 howitzers allied divisions had a firepower only slightly greater than that of world war i germany had six armoured divisions in september 1939 the allies though they had a large number of tanks had no armoured divisions at that time\\n\\nthe six armoured or panzer divisions of the wehrmacht comprised some 2400 tanks and though germany would subsequently expand its tank forces during the first years of the war it was not the number of tanks that germany had the allies had almost as many in september 1939 but the fact of their being organized into divisions and operated as such that was to prove decisive in accordance with the doctrines of general heinz guderian the german tanks were used in massed formations in conjunction with motorized artillery to punch holes in the enemy line and to isolate segments of the enemy which were then surrounded and captured by motorized german infantry divisions while the tanks ranged forward to repeat the process deep drives into enemy territory by panzer divisions were thus followed by mechanized infantry and foot soldiers these tactics were supported by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy’s supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear thus further paralyzing its defensive capabilities mechanization was the key to the german blitzkrieg or “lightning war” so named because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its salient characteristics tested and welltrained in maneuvers the german panzer divisions constituted a force with no equal in europe\\n\\nthe german air force or luftwaffe was also the best force of its kind in 1939 it was a groundcooperation force designed to support the army but its planes were superior to nearly all allied types in the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939 the production of german combat aircraft steadily mounted the table shows the production of german aircraft by years\\n\\nthe standardization of engines and airframes gave the luftwaffe an advantage over its opponents germany had an operational force of 1000 fighters and 1050 bombers in september 1939 the allies actually had more planes in 1939 than germany did but their strength was made up of many different types some of them obsolescent the corresponding table shows the number of firstline military aircraft available to the allies at the outbreak of war\\n\\ngreat britain which was held back by delays in the rearmament program was producing one modern fighter in 1939 the hurricane a higherperformance fighter the spitfire was just coming into production and did not enter the air war in numbers until 1940\\n\\nthe value of the french air force in 1939 was reduced by the number of obsolescent planes in its order of battle 131 of the 634 fighters and nearly all of the 463 bombers france was desperately trying to buy highperformance aircraft in the united states in 1939\\n\\nat sea the odds against germany were much greater in september 1939 than in august 1914 since the allies in 1939 had many more large surface warships than germany had at sea however there was to be no clash between the allied and the german massed fleets but only the individual operation of german pocket battleships and commerce raiders\\n\\nthe war in europe 1939–41\\nthe campaign in poland 1939\\nthe german conquest of poland in september 1939 was the first demonstration in war of the new theory of highspeed armoured warfare that had been adopted by the germans when their rearmament began poland was a country all too well suited for such a demonstration its frontiers were immensely long—about 3500 miles in all and the stretch of 1250 miles adjoining german territory had recently been extended to 1750 miles in all by the german occupation of bohemiamoravia and of slovakia so that poland’s southern flank became exposed to invasion—as the northern flank facing east prussia already was western poland had become a huge salient that lay between germany’s jaws\\n\\nit would have been wiser for the polish army to assemble farther back behind the natural defense line formed by the vistula and san rivers but that would have entailed the abandonment of some of the most valuable western parts of the country including the silesian coalfields and most of the main industrial zone which lay west of the river barrier the economic argument for delaying the german approach to the main industrial zone was heavily reinforced by polish national pride and military overconfidence\\n\\nwhen war broke out the polish army was able to mobilize about 1000000 men a fairly large number the polish army was woefully outmoded however and was almost completely lacking in tanks armoured personnel carriers and antitank and antiaircraft guns yet many of the polish military leaders clung to the double belief that their preponderance of horsed cavalry was an important asset and that they could take the offensive against the german mechanized forces they also tended to discount the effect of germany’s vastly superior air force which was nearly 10 times as powerful as their own\\n\\nthe unrealism of such an attitude was repeated in the polish army’s dispositions approximately onethird of poland’s forces were concentrated in or near the polish corridor in northeastern poland where they were perilously exposed to a double envelopment—from east prussia and the west combined in the south facing the main avenues of a german advance the polish forces were thinly spread at the same time nearly another onethird of poland’s forces were massed in reserve in the northcentral part of the country between łódź and warsaw under the commander in chief marshal edward rydzśmigły the poles’ forward concentration in general forfeited their chance of fighting a series of delaying actions since their footmarching army was unable to retreat to their defensive positions in the rear or to man them before being overrun by the invader’s mechanized columns\\n\\nthe 40odd infantry divisions employed by the germans in the invasion counted for much less than their 14 mechanized or partially mechanized divisions these consisted of six armoured divisions four light divisions consisting of motorized infantry infantry wholly transported by trucks and personnel carriers with two armoured units and four motorized divisions the germans attacked with about 1500000 troops in all it was the deep and rapid thrusts of these mechanized forces that decided the issue in conjunction with the overhead pressure of the luftwaffe which wrecked the polish railway system and destroyed most of the polish air force before it could come into action the luftwaffe’s terrorbombing of polish cities bridges roads rail lines and power stations completed the disorganization of the polish defenses\\n\\non september 1 1939 the german attack began against northern poland general fedor von bock commanded an army group comprising general georg von küchler’s 3rd army which struck southward from east prussia and general günther von kluge’s 4th army which struck eastward across the base of the corridor much stronger in troops and in tanks however was the army group in the south under general gerd von rundstedt attacking from silesia and from the moravian and slovakian border general johannes blaskowitz’s 8th army on the left was to drive eastward against łódź general wilhelm list’s 14th army on the right was to push on toward kraków and to turn the poles’ carpathian flank and general walther von reichenau’s 10th army in the centre with the bulk of the group’s armour was to deliver the decisive blow with a northwestward thrust into the heart of poland by september 3 when kluge in the north had reached the vistula and küchler was approaching the narew river reichenau’s armour was already beyond the warta two days later his left wing was well to the rear of łódź and his right wing at kielce and by september 8 one of his armoured corps was in the outskirts of warsaw having advanced 140 miles in the first week of war light divisions on reichenau’s right were on the vistula between warsaw and sandomierz by september 9 while list in the south was on the san above and below przemyśl at the same time the 3rd army tanks led by guderian were across the narew attacking the line of the bug river behind warsaw all the german armies had made progress in fulfilling their parts in the great enveloping maneuver planned by general franz halder chief of the general staff and directed by general walther von brauchitsch the commander in chief the polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments some of which were retreating while others were delivering disjointed attacks on the nearest german columns\\n\\non september 10 the polish commander in chief marshal edward rydzśmigły ordered a general retreat to the southeast the germans however were by that time not only tightening their net around the polish forces west of the vistula in the łódź area and still farther west around poznań but also penetrating deeply into eastern poland the polish defense was already reduced to random efforts by isolated bodies of troops when another blow fell on september 17 1939 soviet forces entered poland from the east the next day the polish government and high command crossed the romanian frontier on their way into exile the warsaw garrison held out against the germans until september 28 undergoing terrorbombings and artillery barrages that reduced parts of the city to rubble with no regard for the civilian population the last considerable fragment of the polish army resisted until october 5 and some guerrilla fighting went on into the winter the germans took a total of 700000 prisoners and about 80000 polish soldiers escaped over neutral frontiers approximately 70000 polish soldiers were killed and more than 130000 wounded during the battle whereas the germans sustained about 45000 total casualties poland was conquered for partition between germany and the ussr the forces of which met and greeted each other on polish soil on september 28 another secret german–soviet protocol modified the arrangements of august all lithuania was to be a soviet sphere of influence not a german one but the dividing line in poland was changed in germany’s favour being moved eastward to the bug river\\n\\nlearn more\\nthe baltic states and the russofinnish war 1939–40\\nprofiting quickly from its understanding with germany the ussr on october 10 1939 constrained estonia latvia and lithuania to admit soviet garrisons onto their territories approached with similar demands finland refused to comply even though the ussr offered territorial compensation elsewhere for the cessions that it was requiring for its own strategic reasons finland’s armed forces amounted to about 200000 troops in 10 divisions the soviets eventually brought about 70 divisions about 1000000 men to bear in their attack on finland along with about 1000 tanks soviet troops attacked finland on november 30 1939\\n\\nthe invaders succeeded in isolating the little arctic port of petsamo in the far north but were ignominiously repulsed on all of the fronts chosen for their advance on the karelian isthmus the massive reinforcedconcrete fortifications of finland’s mannerheim line blocked the soviet forces’ direct land route from leningrad into finland the soviet planners had grossly underestimated the finns’ national will to resist and the natural obstacles constituted by the terrain’s numerous lakes and forests\\n\\nthe western powers exulted overtly over the humiliation of the soviet union one important effect of finland’s early successes was to reinforce the tendency of both hitler and the western democracies to underestimate the soviet military capabilities but in the meantime the soviet strategists digested their hardlearned military lessons\\n\\non february 1 1940 the red army launched 14 divisions into a major assault on the mannerheim line the offensive’s weight was concentrated along a 10mile sector of the line near summa which was pounded by a tremendous artillery bombardment as the fortifications were pulverized tanks and sledgecarried infantry advanced to occupy the ground while the soviet air force broke up attempted finnish counterattacks after little more than a fortnight of this methodical process a breach was made through the whole depth of the mannerheim line once the soviets had forced a passage on the karelian isthmus finland’s eventual collapse was certain on march 6 finland sued for peace and a week later the soviet terms were accepted the finns had to cede the entire karelian isthmus viipuri and their part of the rybachy peninsula to the soviets the finns had suffered about 70000 casualties in the campaign the soviets more than 200000\\n\\nthe war in the west september 1939–june 1940\\nduring their campaign in poland the germans kept only 23 divisions in the west to guard their frontier against the french who had nearly five times as many divisions mobilized the french commander in chief general mauricegustave gamelin proposed an advance against germany through neutral belgium and the netherlands in order to have room to exercise his ponderous military machine he was overruled however and french assaults on the 100mile stretch of available front along the francogerman frontier had barely dented the german defenses when the collapse of poland prompted the recall of gamelin’s advanced divisions to defensive positions in the maginot line from october 1939 to march 1940 successive plans were developed for counteraction in the event of a german offensive through belgium—all of them based on the assumption that the germans would come across the plain north of namur not across the hilly and wooded ardennes the germans would indeed have taken the route foreseen by the french if hitler’s desire for an offensive in november 1939 had not been frustrated on the one hand by bad weather and on the other by the hesitations of his generals but in march 1940 the bold suggestion of general erich von manstein that an offensive through the ardennes should in fact be practicable for tank forces was adopted by hitler despite orthodox military opinion\\n\\nmeanwhile hitler’s immediate outlook had been changed by considerations about scandinavia originally he had intended to respect norway’s neutrality then rumours leaked out prematurely of british designs on norway—as in fact winston churchill first lord of the admiralty was arguing that mines should be laid in norwegian waters to stop the export of swedish iron ore from gällivare to germany through norway’s rail terminus and port of narvik the british cabinet in response to churchill authorized at least the preparation of a plan for a landing at narvik and in middecember 1939 a norwegian politician vidkun quisling leader of a pronazi party was introduced to hitler on january 27 1940 hitler ordered plans for an invasion of norway for use if he could no longer respect norway’s neutrality\\n\\nafter france’s failure to interrupt the german conquest of poland the western powers and the germans were so inactive with regard to land operations that journalists began to speak derisively over the next six months of the “phony war” at sea however the period was somewhat more eventful german uboats sank the british aircraft carrier courageous september 17 and the battleship royal oak october 14 the uboats’ main warfare however was against merchant shipping they sank more than 110 vessels in the first four months of the war both the germans and the british meanwhile were engaged in extensive mine laying\\n\\nin surface warfare at sea the british were on the whole more fortunate than the germans a german pocket battleship in the atlantic the admiral graf spee sank nine ships before coming to a tragic end having sustained and inflicted damage in an engagement with three british cruisers off the río de la plata on dec 13 1939 she made off to montevideo and obtained leave to spend four days there for repairs the british mustered reinforcements for the two cruisers still capable of action after the engagement namely the ajax and the achilles and brought the cumberland to the scene in time but on december 17 when the graf spee put to sea again her crew scuttled her a little way out of the harbour before the fight could be resumed\\n\\nlearn more\\nthe invasion of norway\\nbritish plans for landings on the norwegian coast in the third week of march 1940 were temporarily postponed prime minister neville chamberlain however was by that time convinced that some aggressive action ought to be taken and paul reynaud who succeeded édouard daladier as france’s premier on march 21 was of the same opinion reynaud had come into office on the surge of the french public’s demand for a more aggressive military policy and quicker offensive action against germany it was agreed that mines should be laid in norwegian waters and that the mining should be followed by the landing of troops at four norwegian ports narvik trondheim bergen and stavanger\\n\\nbecause of anglofrench arguments the date of the mining was postponed from april 5 to april 8 the postponement was catastrophic hitler had on april 1 ordered the german invasion of norway to begin on april 9 so when on april 8 the norwegian government was preoccupied with earnest protest about the british mine laying the german expeditions were well on their way\\n\\non april 9 1940 the major norwegian ports from oslo northward to narvik 1200 miles away from germany’s naval bases were occupied by advance detachments of german troops at the same time a single parachute battalion the first ever employed in warfare took the oslo and stavanger airfields and 800 operational aircraft overawed the norwegian population norwegian resistance at narvik at trondheim the strategic key to norway at bergen at stavanger and at kristiansand had been overcome very quickly and oslo’s effective resistance to the seaborne forces was nullified when german troops from the airfield entered the city\\n\\nsimultaneously along with their norwegian enterprise the germans on april 9 occupied denmark sending troopships covered by aircraft into copenhagen harbour and marching over the land frontier into jutland this occupation was obviously necessary for the safety of their communications with norway\\n\\nallied troops began to land at narvik on april 14 shortly afterward british troops were landed also at namsos and at åndalsnes to attack trondheim from the north and from the south respectively the germans however landed fresh troops in the rear of the british at namsos and advanced up the gudbrandsdal from oslo against the force at åndalsnes by this time the germans had about 25000 troops in norway by may 2 both namsos and åndalsnes were evacuated by the british the germans at narvik held out against five times as many british and french troops until may 27 by that time the german offensive in france had progressed to such an extent that the british could no longer afford any commitment in norway and the 25000 allied troops were evacuated from narvik 10 days after their victory the norwegian king haakon vii and his government left norway for britain at the same time hitler garrisoned norway with about 300000 troops for the rest of the war by occupying norway hitler had ensured the protection of germany’s supply of iron ore from sweden and had obtained naval and air bases with which to strike at britain if necessary\\n\\nwhat was to happen in norway became a less important question for the western powers when on may 10 1940 they were surprised by hitler’s longdebated stroke against them through the low countries\\n\\nas the 1918 flu emerged coverup and denial helped it spread\\nnations fighting in world war i were reluctant to report their flu outbreaks\\n“spanish flu” has been used to describe the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919 and the name suggests the outbreak started in spain but the term is actually a misnomer and points to a key fact nations involved in world war i didn’t accurately report their flu outbreaks \\n\\nspain remained neutral throughout world war i and its press freely reported its flu cases including when the spanish king alfonso xiii contracted it in the spring of 1918 this led to the misperception that the flu had originated or was at its worst in spain\\n\\n“basically it gets called the ‘spanish flu’ because the spanish media did their job” says lora vogt curator of education at the national wwi museum and memorial in kansas city missouri in great britain and the united states—which has a long history of blaming other countries for disease—the outbreak was also known as the “spanish grip” or “spanish lady”\\nhistorians aren’t actually sure where the 1918 flu strain began but the first recorded cases were at a us army camp in kansas in march 1918 by the end of 1919 it had infected up to a third of the world’s population and killed some 50 million people it was the worst flu pandemic in recorded history and it was likely exacerbated by a combination of censorship skepticism and denial among warring nations\\ninvasion of the soviet union 1941\\n\\nfor the campaign against the soviet union the germans allotted almost 150 divisions containing a total of about 3000000 men among these were 19 panzer divisions and in total the “barbarossa” force had about 3000 tanks 7000 artillery pieces and 2500 aircraft it was in effect the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history the germans’ strength was further increased by more than 30 divisions of finnish and romanian troops\\n\\nthe soviet union had twice or perhaps three times the number of both tanks and aircraft as the germans had but their aircraft were mostly obsolete the soviet tanks were about equal to those of the germans however a greater hindrance to hitler’s chances of victory was that the german intelligence service underestimated the troop reserves that stalin could bring up from the depths of the ussr the germans correctly estimated that there were about 150 divisions in the western parts of the ussr and reckoned that 50 more might be produced but the soviets actually brought up more than 200 fresh divisions by the middle of august making a total of 360 the consequence was that though the germans succeeded in shattering the original soviet armies by superior technique they then found their path blocked by fresh ones the effects of the miscalculations were increased because much of august was wasted while hitler and his advisers were having long arguments as to what course they should follow after their initial victories another factor in the germans’ calculations was purely political though no less mistaken they believed that within three to six months of their invasion the soviet regime would collapse from lack of domestic support\\n\\nthe german attack on the soviet union was to have an immediate and highly salutary effect on great britain’s situation until then britain’s prospects had appeared hopeless in the eyes of most people except the british themselves and the government’s decision to continue the struggle after the fall of france and to reject hitler’s peace offers could spell only slow suicide unless relief came from either the united states or the ussr hitler brought great britain relief by turning eastward and invading the soviet union just as the strain on britain was becoming severe\\n\\non june 22 1941 the german offensive was launched by three army groups under the same commanders as in the invasion of france in 1940 on the left north an army group under leeb struck from east prussia into the baltic states toward leningrad on the right south another army group under rundstedt with an armoured group under kleist advanced from southern poland into the ukraine against kiev whence it was to wheel southeastward to the coasts of the black sea and the sea of azov and in the centre north of the pripet marshes the main blow was delivered by bock’s army group with one armoured group under guderian and another under hoth thrusting northeastward at smolensk and moscow\\n\\nthe invasion along a 1800mile front took the soviet leadership completely by surprise and caught the red army in an unprepared and partially demobilized state piercing the northern border guderian’s tanks raced 50 miles beyond the frontier on the first day of the invasion and were at minsk 200 miles beyond it on june 27 at minsk they converged with hoth’s tanks which had pierced the opposite flank but bock’s infantry could not follow up quickly enough to complete the encirclement of the soviet troops in the area though 300000 prisoners were taken in the salient a large part of the soviet forces was able to escape to the east the soviet armies were clumsily handled and frittered their tank strength away in piecemeal action like that of the french in 1940 but the isolated soviet troops fought with a stubbornness that the french had not shown and their resistance imposed a brake by continuing to block road centres long after the german tide had swept past them the result was similar when guderian’s tanks having crossed the dnieper river on july 10 entered smolensk six days later and converged with hoth’s thrust through vitebsk 200000 soviet prisoners were taken but some soviet forces were withdrawn from the trap to the line of the desna and a large pocket of resistance lay behind the german armour by midjuly moreover a series of rainstorms were turning the sandy russian roads into clogging mud over which the wheeled vehicles of the german transport behind the tanks could make only very slow progress the germans also began to be hampered by the scorched earth policy adopted by the retreating soviets the soviet troops burned crops destroyed bridges and evacuated factories in the face of the german advance entire steel and munitions plants in the westernmost portions of the ussr were dismantled and shipped by rail to the east where they were put back into production the soviets also destroyed or evacuated most of their rolling stock railroad cars thus depriving the germans of the use of the soviet rail system since soviet railroad track was of a different gauge than german track and german rolling stock was consequently useless on it\\n\\nnevertheless by midjuly the germans had advanced more than 400 miles and were only 200 miles from moscow they still had ample time to make decisive gains before the onset of winter but they lost the opportunity primarily because of arguments throughout august between hitler and the okh about the destination of the next thrusts thence whereas the okh proposed moscow as the main objective hitler wanted the major effort to be directed southeastward through the ukraine and the donets basin into the caucasus with a minor swing northwestward against leningrad to converge with leeb’s army group\\n\\nin the ukraine meanwhile rundstedt and kleist had made short work of the foremost soviet defenses stronger though the latter had been a new soviet front south of kiev was broken by the end of july and in the next fortnight the germans swept down to the black sea mouths of the bug and dnieper rivers—to converge with romania’s simultaneous offensive kleist was then ordered to wheel northward from the ukraine guderian southward from smolensk for a pincer movement around the soviet forces behind kiev and by the end of september the claws of the encircling movement had caught 520000 men these gigantic encirclements were partly the fault of inept soviet high commanders and partly the fault of stalin who as commander in chief stubbornly overrode the advice of his generals and ordered his armies to stand and fight instead of allowing them to retreat eastward and regroup in preparation for a counteroffensive\\n\\nwinter was approaching and hitler stopped leeb’s northward drive on the outskirts of leningrad he ordered rundstedt and kleist however to press on from the dnieper toward the don and the caucasus and bock was to resume the advance on moscow\\n\\nbock’s renewed advance on moscow began on october 2 1941 its prospects looked bright when bock’s armies brought off a great encirclement around vyazma where 600000 more soviet troops were captured that left the germans momentarily with an almost clear path to moscow but the vyazma battle had not been completed until late october the german troops were tired the country became a morass as the weather got worse and fresh soviet forces appeared in the path as they plodded slowly forward some of the german generals wanted to break off the offensive and to take up a suitable winter line but bock wanted to press on believing that the soviets were on the verge of collapse while brauchitsch and halder tended to agree with his view as that also accorded with hitler’s desire he made no objection the temptation of moscow now so close in front of their eyes was too great for any of the topmost leaders to resist on december 2 a further effort was launched and some german detachments penetrated into the suburbs of moscow but the advance as a whole was held up in the forests covering the capital the stemming of this last phase of the great german offensive was partly due to the effects of the russian winter whose subzero temperatures were the most severe in several decades in october and november a wave of frostbite cases had decimated the illclad german troops for whom provisions of winter clothing had not been made while the icy cold paralyzed the germans’ mechanized transport tanks artillery and aircraft the soviets by contrast were well clad and tended to fight more effectively in winter than did the germans by this time german casualties had mounted to levels that were unheard of in the campaigns against france and the balkans by november the germans had suffered about 730000 casualties\\n\\nin the south kleist had already reached rostovondon gateway to the caucasus on november 22 but had exhausted his tanks’ fuel in doing so rundstedt seeing the place to be untenable wanted to evacuate it but was overruled by hitler a soviet counteroffensive recaptured rostov on november 28 and rundstedt was relieved of his command four days later the germans however managed to establish a front on the mius river—as rundstedt had recommended\\n\\nas the german drive against moscow slackened the soviet commander on the moscow front general georgy konstantinovich zhukov on december 6 inaugurated the first great counteroffensive with strokes against bock’s right in the elets yelets and tula sectors south of moscow and against his centre in the klin and kalinin sectors to the northwest levies of siberian troops who were extremely effective fighters in cold weather were used for these offensives there followed a blow at the german left in the velikie luki sector and the counteroffensive which was sustained throughout the winter of 1941–42 soon took the form of a triple convergence toward smolensk\\n\\nthese soviet counteroffensives tumbled back the exhausted germans lapped around their flanks and produced a critical situation from generals downward the invaders were filled with ghastly thoughts of napoleon’s retreat from moscow in that emergency hitler forbade any retreat beyond the shortest possible local withdrawals his decision exposed his troops to awful sufferings in their advanced positions facing moscow for they had neither the clothing nor the equipment for a russian winter campaign but if they had once started a general retreat it might easily have degenerated into a panicstricken rout\\n\\nthe red army’s winter counteroffensive continued for more than three months after its december launching though with diminishing progress by march 1942 it had advanced more than 150 miles in some sectors but the germans maintained their hold on the main bastions of their winter front—such towns as schlüsselburg novgorod rzhev vyazma bryansk orël oryol kursk kharkov and taganrog—despite the fact that the soviets had often advanced many miles beyond these bastions which were in effect cut off in retrospect it became clear that hitler’s veto on any extensive withdrawal worked out in such a way as to restore the confidence of the german troops and probably saved them from a widespread collapse nevertheless they paid a heavy price indirectly for that rigid defense one immediate handicap was that the strength of the luftwaffe was drained in the prolonged effort to maintain supplies by air under winter conditions to the garrisons of these more or less isolated bastion towns the tremendous strain of that winter campaign on armies which had not been prepared for it had other serious effects before the winter ended many german divisions were reduced to barely a third of their original strength and they were never fully built up again\\n\\nthe german plan of campaign had begun to miscarry in august 1941 and its failure was patent when the soviet counteroffensive started nevertheless having dismissed brauchitsch and appointed himself army commander in chief in december hitler persisted in overruling the tentative opposition of the general staff to his strategy\\n\\nthe first three months of the german–soviet conflict produced cautious rapprochements between the ussr and great britain and between the ussr and the united states the anglosoviet agreement of july 12 1941 pledged the signatory powers to assist one another and to abstain from making any separate peace with germany on august 25 1941 british and soviet forces jointly invaded iran to forestall the establishment of a german base there and to divide the country into spheres of occupation for the duration of the war and late in september—at a conference in moscow—soviet british and us representatives formulated the monthly quantities of supplies including aircraft tanks and raw materials that great britain and the united states should try to furnish to the soviet union\\n\\nthe critical situation on the eastern front did not deter hitler from declaring germany to be at war with the united states on december 11 1941 after the japanese attack on the us british and dutch positions in the pacific and in the far east see below japanese policy 1939–41 since this extension of hostilities did not immediately commit the german land forces to any new theatre but at the same time had the merit of entitling the german navy to intensify the war at seathe war in the pacific 1938–41\\nthe war in china 1937–41\\n\\nin 1931–32 the japanese had invaded manchuria northeast china and after overcoming ineffective chinese resistance there had created the japanesecontrolled puppet state of manchukuo in the following years the nationalist government of china headed by chiang kaishek temporized in the face of japanese military and diplomatic pressures and instead waged an internal war against the chinese communists led by mao zedong who were based in shensi province in northcentral china meanwhile the japanese began a military buildup in north china proper which in turn stimulated the formation of a unified resistance by the nationalists and the communists\\n\\novert hostilities between japan and china began after the marco polo bridge incident of july 7 1937 when shots were exchanged between chinese and japanese troops on the outskirts of peking open fighting broke out in that area and in late july the japanese captured the pekingtientsin area thereupon fullscale hostilities began between the two nations the japanese landed near shanghai at the mouth of the yangtze river and took shanghai in november and the chinese capital nanking in december 1937 chiang kaishek moved his government to hank’ou one of the wuhan cities which lay 435 miles west of shanghai along the yangtze the japanese also pushed southward and westward from the peking area into hopeh and shansi provinces in 1938 the japanese launched several ambitious military campaigns that brought them deep into the heart of central china they advanced to the northeast and west from nanking taking suchow and occupying the wuhan cities the nationalists were forced to move their government to chungking in szechwan province about 500 miles west of the wuhan cities the japanese also occupied canton and several other coastal cities in south china in 1938\\n\\nnationalist chinese resistance to these japanese advances was ineffective primarily because the nationalist leadership was still more interested in holding their forces in reserve for a future struggle with the communists than in repelling the japanese by contrast the communists from their base in northcentral china began an increasingly effective guerrilla war against the japanese troops in manchuria and north china the japanese needed large numbers of troops to maintain their hold on the immense chinese territories and populations they controlled of the 51 infantry divisions making up the japanese army in 1941 38 of them comprising about 750000 men were stationed in china including manchuriajapanese policy 1939–41\\n\\nwhen war broke out in europe in september 1939 the japanese despite a series of victorious battles had still not brought their war in china to an end on the one hand the japanese strategists had made no plans to cope with the guerrilla warfare pursued by the chinese on the other the japanese commanders in the field often disregarded the orders of the supreme command at the imperial headquarters and occupied more chinese territory than they had been ordered to take half of the japanese army was thus still tied down in china when the commitment of great britain and france to war against germany opened up the prospect of wider conquests for japan in southeast asia and in the pacific japan’s military ventures in china proper were consequently restricted rather more severely henceforth\\n\\nthe german victories over the netherlands and france in the summer of 1940 further encouraged the japanese premier prince konoe to look southward at those defeated powers’ colonies and also of course at the british and us positions in the far east the island archipelago of the dutch east indies now indonesia along with french indochina and britishheld malaya contained raw materials tin rubber petroleum that were essential to japan’s industrial economy and if japan could seize these regions and incorporate them into the empire it could make itself virtually selfsufficient economically and thus become the dominant power in the pacific ocean since great britain singlehandedly was confronting the might of the axis in europe the japanese strategists had to reckon primarily with the opposition of the united states to their plans for territorial aggrandizement when japanese troops entered northern indochina in september 1940 in pursuance of an agreement extorted in august from the vichy government of france the united states uttered a protest germany and italy by contrast recognized japan as the leading power in the far east by concluding with it the tripartite or axis pact of september 27 1940 negotiated by japanese foreign minister matsuoka yosuke the pact pledged its signatories to come to one another’s help in the event of an attack “by a power not already engaged in war” japan also concluded a neutrality pact with the ussr on april 13 1941\\n\\non july 2 1941 the imperial conference decided to press the japanese advance southward even at the risk of war with great britain and the united states and this policy was pursued even when matsuoka was relieved of office a fortnight later on july 26 in pursuance of a new agreement with vichy france japanese forces began to occupy bases in southern indochina\\n\\nthis time the united states reacted vigorously not only freezing japanese assets under us control but also imposing an embargo on supplies of oil to japan dismay at the embargo drove the japanese naval command which had hitherto been more moderate than the army into collusion with the army’s extremism when negotiations with the dutch of indonesia for an alternative supply of oil produced no satisfaction the imperial conference on september 6 at the high command’s insistence decided that war must be undertaken against the united states and great britain unless an understanding with the united states could be reached in a few weeks’ time\\n\\ngeneral tōjō hideki who succeeded konoe as premier in midoctober 1941 continued the already desperate talks the united states however persisted in making demands that japan could not concede renunciation of the tripartite pact which would have left japan diplomatically isolated the withdrawal of japanese troops from china and from southeast asia a humiliating retreat from an overt commitment of four years’ standing and an opendoor regime for trade in china when cordell hull the us secretary of state on november 26 1941 sent an abrupt note to the japanese bluntly requiring them to evacuate china and indochina and to recognize no chinese regime other than that of chiang kaishek the japanese could see no point in continuing the talks see sidebar pearl harbor and the “back door to war” theory\\n\\nsince peace with the united states seemed impossible japan set in motion its plans for war which would now necessarily be waged not only against the united states but also against great britain the existing war effort of which depended on us support and the far eastern colonies of which lay within the orbit of the projected japanese expansion and against the dutch east indies the oil of which was essential to japanese enterprises even apart from geopolitical considerations\\n\\nthe evolving japanese military strategy was based on the peculiar geography of the pacific ocean and on the relative weakness and unpreparedness of the allied military presence in that ocean the western half of the pacific is dotted with many islands large and small while the eastern half of the ocean is with the exception of the hawaiian islands almost devoid of landmasses and hence of usable bases the british french american and dutch military forces in the entire pacific region west of hawaii amounted to only about 350000 troops most of them lacking combat experience and being of disparate nationalities allied air power in the pacific was weak and consisted mostly of obsolete planes if the japanese with their large wellequipped armies that had been battlehardened in china could quickly launch coordinated attacks from their existing bases on certain japanesemandated pacific islands on formosa taiwan and from japan itself they could overwhelm the allied forces overrun the entire western pacific ocean as well as southeast asia and then develop those areas’ resources to their own militaryindustrial advantage if successful in their campaigns the japanese planned to establish a strongly fortified defensive perimeter extending from burma in the west to the southern rim of the dutch east indies and northern new guinea in the south and sweeping around to the gilbert and marshall islands in the southeast and east the japanese believed that any american and british counteroffensives against this perimeter could be repelled after which those nations would eventually seek a negotiated peace that would allow japan to keep her newly won empire\\n\\nuntil the end of 1940 the japanese strategists had assumed that any new war to be waged would be against a single enemy when it became clear in 1941 that the british and the dutch as well as the americans must be attacked a new and daring war plan was successfully sponsored by the commander in chief of the combined fleet admiral yamamoto isoroku\\n\\nyamamoto’s plan prescribed two operations together involving the whole strength of his navy which was composed of the following ships 10 battleships six regular aircraft carriers four auxiliary carriers 18 heavy cruisers 20 light cruisers 112 destroyers 65 submarines and 2274 combat planes the first operation to which all six regular aircraft carriers two battleships three cruisers and 11 destroyers were allocated was to be a surprise attack scheduled for december 7 december 8 by japanese time on the main us pacific fleet in its base at pearl harbor in the hawaiian islands the rest of the japanese navy was to support the army in the “southern operation” 11 infantry divisions and seven tank regiments assisted by 795 combat planes were to undertake two drives one from formosa through the philippines the other from french indochina and hainan island through malaya so as to converge on the dutch east indies with a view to the capture of java as the culmination of a campaign of 150 days—during which moreover wake island guam the gilbert islands and burma should also have been secured as outer bastions besides hong kongthe allies’ first decisive successes\\nthe solomons papua madagascar the aleutians and burma july 1942–may 1943\\non july 2 1942 the us joint chiefs of staff ordered limited offensives in three stages to recapture the new britain–new ireland–solomons–eastern new guinea area first the seizure of tulagi and of the santa cruz islands with adjacent positions second the occupation of the central and northern solomons and of the northeast coast of new guinea third the seizure of rabaul and of other points in the bismarck archipelago\\n\\non july 6 the japanese landed troops on guadalcanal one of the southern solomons and began to construct an air base the allied high command fearing further japanese advances southeastward sped into the area to dislodge the enemy and to obtain a base for later advances toward japan’s main base in the theatre rabaul the us 1st marine division poured ashore on august 7 and secured guadalcanal’s airfield tulagi’s harbour and neighbouring islands by dusk on august 8—the pacific war’s first major allied offensive during the night of august 8–9 japanese cruisers and destroyers attempting to hold guadalcanal sank four us cruisers themselves sustaining one cruiser sunk and one damaged and later sunk on august 23–25 in the battle of the eastern solomons the japanese lost a light carrier a destroyer and a submarine and sustained damage to a cruiser and to a seaplane carrier but sank an allied destroyer and crippled a cruiser on august 31 another us carrier was disabled and on september 15 japanese submarines sank the carrier wasp and damaged a battleship meanwhile more than 6000 japanese reinforced their guadalcanal garrison attacking the marines’ beachhead on august 20–21 and on september 12–14 on september 18 some us reinforcements arrived and midoctober saw about 22000 japanese ranged against 23000 us troops the sea battles of cape esperance and of the santa cruz islands—in which two japanese cruisers and two destroyers were sunk and three carriers and two destroyers damaged in return for the loss of one us carrier and two destroyers besides damage to six other allied ships—thwarted an attempt to reinforce further the japanese ground troops whose attack proved a failure october 20–29\\n\\nafter october allied strength was built up another japanese attempt at counterreinforcement led to the naval battle of guadalcanal fought on november 13–15 it cost japan two battleships three destroyers one cruiser two submarines and 11 transports and the allies now under admiral william f halsey two cruisers and seven destroyers sunk and one battleship and one cruiser damaged only 4000 japanese troops out of 12500 managed to reach land without equipment and on november 30 eight japanese destroyers attempting to land more troops were beaten off in the battle of tassafaronga losing one destroyer sunk and one crippled at an allied cost of one cruiser sunk and three damaged\\n\\nby jan 5 1943 guadalcanal’s allied garrison totaled 44000 against 22500 japanese the japanese decided to evacuate the position carrying away 12000 men in early february in daring destroyer runs in ground

the north coast of papua the southeastern extremity of the great island on july 24 1942 in an attempt to reach port moresby overland via the kokoda trail advanced japanese units from the north despite australian opposition had reached a ridge 32 miles from port moresby by midseptember then however they had to withdraw exhausted to gona and to nearby buna where there were some 7500 japanese assembled by november 18 the next day us infantry attacked them there each side was subsequently reinforced but the australians took gona on december 9 and the americans buna village on december 14

drive south and communications with australia and new zealand were now secure altogether papua cost japan nearly 12000 killed and 350 captured allied losses were 3300 killed and 5500 wounded allied air forces had played a particularly important role interdicting japanese supply lines and transporting allied supplies and reinforcements\\n\\njapan having lost guadalcanal fought henceforth defensively with worsening prospects its final effort to reinforce the lae–salamaua position in new guinea from the stronghold of rabaul was a disaster in the battle of the bismarck sea on march 2–4 1943 the japanese lost four destroyers and eight transports and only 1000 of the 7000 troops reached their destination on march 25 the japanese army and navy high commands agreed on a policy of strengthening the defense of strategic points and of counterattacking wherever possible priority being given to the defense of the remaining japanese positions in new guinea with secondary emphasis on the solomon islands in the following three weeks however the allies improved their own position in new guinea and japanese intervention was confined to air attacks before the end of april moreover the japanese navy sustained a disaster the guiding genius of the japanese war effort yamamoto was sent late in march to command the forces based on rabaul but was killed in an american air ambush on a flight to bougainville\\n\\ndevelopments of the allies’ war against japan also took place outside the southwest pacific area british forces in the summer of 1942 invaded vichy frenchheld madagascar a

there can be no conceivable secession at first and despite the sétif massacre of 8 may 1945 and the proindependence struggle before world war ii most algerians were in favor of a relative statusquo while messali hadj had radicalized by forming the fln ferhat abbas maintained a more moderate electoral strategy fewer than 500 fellaghas proindependence fighters could be counted at the beginning of the conflict50 the algerian population radicalized itself in particular because of the terrorist acts of frenchsponsored main rouge red hand group which targeted anticolonialists in all of the maghreb

neutrality toward the fln the communists who had made no move to cooperate in the uprising at the start later tried to infiltrate the fln but fln leaders publicly repudiated the support of the party in april 1956 abbas flew to cairo where he formally joined the fln this action brought in many évolués who had supported the udma in the past the auma also threw the full weight of its prestige behind the fln bendjelloul and the prointegrationist moderates had already abandoned their efforts to mediate between the french and the rebels\\n\\nafter the collapse of the mtld the veteran nationalist messali hadj formed the leftist mouvement national algérien mna which advocated a policy of violent revolution and total independence similar to that of the fln but aimed to compete with that organisation the armée de libération nationale aln the military wing of the fln subsequently wiped out the mna guerrilla operation in algeria and messali hadjs movement lost what little influence it had had there however the mna retained the support of many algerian workers in france through the union syndicale des travailleurs algériens the union of algerian workers the fln also established a strong organization in france to oppose the mna the café wars resulting in nearly 5000 deaths were waged in france between the two rebel groups throughout the years of the war of independence\\n\\non

and cities the french piedsnoirs and urban french population began to demand that the french government engage in sterner countermeasures including the proclamation of a state of emergency capital punishment for political crimes denunciation of all separatists and most ominously a call for titfortat reprisal operations by police military and paramilitary forces colon vigilante units whose unauthorized activities were conducted with the passive cooperation of police authorities carried out ratonnades literally rathunts raton being a racist term for denigrating muslim algerians against

moved into urbanized areas an important watershed in the war of independence was the massacre of piedsnoirs civilians by the fln near the town of philippeville now known as skikda in august 1955 before this operation fln policy was to attack only military and governmentrelated targets the commander of the constantine wilayaregion however decided a drastic escalation was needed the killing by the fln and its supporters of 123 people including 71 french including old women and babies shocked jacques soustelle into calling for more repressive measures against the rebels the french authorities stated that 1273 guerrillas died in what soustelle admitted were severe reprisals the fln subsequently claimed that 12000 muslims were killed122 soustelles repression was an early cause of the algerian populations rallying to the fln after philippeville soustelle declared sterner measures and an allout war began in 1956 demonstrations by french algerians caused the french government to not make reforms\\n\\nsoustelles successor governor general lacoste a socialist abolished the algerian assembly lacoste saw the assembly which was dominated by piedsnoirs as hindering the work of his administration and he undertook the rule of algeria by decree he favored stepping up french military operations and granted the army exceptional police powers—a concession of dubious legality under french law—to deal with the mounting political violence at the same time lacoste proposed a new administrative structure to give algeria some autonomy and a decentralized government whilst remaining an integral part of france algeria was to be divided into five districts each of which would have a territorial assembly elected from a single slate of candidates until 1958 deputies representing algerian districts were able to delay the passage of the measure by the national assembly of france\\n\\nin august and september 1956 the leadership of the fln guerrillas operating within algeria

breach between the internals and externals widened to halt the drift the fln expanded its executive committee to include abbas as well as imprisoned political leaders such as ben bella it also convinced communist and arab members of the united nations un to put diplomatic pressure on the french government to negotiate a ceasefire in 1957 it became common knowledge in france that the french

that they dont have the right to condemn in the same terms as ten years ago the destruction of oradour and the torture by the gestapo another case that attracted much media attention was the murder of maurice audin a communist mathematics professor at the university of algiers and a suspected fln member whom the french army arrested in june 1957224 audin was tortured and killed and his body was never found54 as audin was french rather than algerian his disappearance while in the custody of the french army led to the case becoming a cause célèbre as his widow aided by the historian pierre

to persuade both sides to at least leave civilians alone writing editorials against the use of torture in combat newspaper the fln considered him a fool and some piedsnoirs considered him a traitor

that camus though discreet was in fact an ardent supporter of french algeria in the last years of his lifebattle of algiers\\nto increase international and domestic french attention to their struggle the fln decided to bring the conflict to the cities and to call a nationwide general strike and also to plant bombs in public places the most notable instance was the battle of algiers which began on september 30 1956 when three women including djamila bouhired and zohra drif simultaneously placed bombs at three sites including the downtown office of air france the fln carried out shootings and bombings in the spring of 1957 resulting in civilian casualties and a crushing response from the authorities\\n\\ngeneral jacques massu was instructed to use whatever methods deemed necessary to restore order in the city and to find and eliminate terrorists using paratroopers he broke the strike and in the succeeding months destroyed the fln infrastructure in algiers but the fln had succeeded in showing its ability to strike at the heart of french algeria and to assemble a mass response to its demands among urban muslims the publicity given to the brutal methods used by the army to win the battle of algiers including the use of torture strong movement control and curfew called quadrillage and where all authority was under the military created doubt in france about its role in algeria what was originally pacification or a public order operation had turned into a colonial war accompanied by torture\\n\\nguerrilla war\\nduring 1956 and 1957 the fln successfully applied hitandrun tactics in accordance with guerrilla warfare theory whilst some of this was aimed at military targets a significant amount was invested in a terror campaign against those in any way deemed to support or encourage french authority this resulted in acts of sadistic torture and brutal violence against all including women and children specializing in ambushes and night raids and avoiding direct contact with superior french firepower the internal forces targeted army patrols military encampments police posts and colonial farms mines and factories as well as transportation and communications

mutilation of civilians55dubious – discuss see torture section\\n\\nalthough successfully provoking fear and uncertainty within both communities in algeria the revolutionaries coercive tactics suggested that they had not yet inspired the bulk of the muslim people to revolt against french colonial rule gradually however the fln gained control in certain sectors of the aurès the kabylie and other mountainous areas around constantine and south of algiers and oran in these places the fln established a simple but effective—although frequently temporary—military administration that was able to collect taxes and food and to recruit manpower but it was never able to hold large fixed positions\\n\\nthe loss of competent field commanders both on the battlefield and through defections and political purges created difficulties for the fln moreover power struggles in the early years of the war split leadership in the wilayat particularly in the aurès some officers created their own fiefdoms using units under their command to settle old scores and engage in private wars against military rivals within the fln\\nfrench counterinsurgency operations\\ndespite complaints from the military command in algiers the french government was reluctant for many months to admit that the algerian situation was out of control and that what was viewed officially as a pacification operation had developed into a war by 1956 there were more than 400000 french troops in algeria although the elite colonial infantry airborne units and the foreign legion bore the brunt of offensive counterinsurgency combat operations approximately 170000 muslim algerians also served in the regular french army most of them volunteers france also sent air force and naval units to the algerian theater including helicopters in addition to service as a flying ambulance and cargo carrier french forces utilized the helicopter for the first time in a ground attack role in order to pursue and destroy fleeing fln guerrilla units the american military later used the same helicopter combat methods in the vietnam war the french also used napalm56 which was depicted for the first time in the

administrative spécialisée sas created in 1955 the sass mission was to establish contact with the muslim population and weaken nationalist influence in the rural areas by asserting the french presence there sas officers—called képis bleus blue caps—also recruited and trained bands of loyal muslim irregulars known as harkis armed with shotguns and using guerrilla tactics similar to those of the fln the harkis who eventually numbered about 180000 volunteers more than the fln activists57 were an ideal instrument of counterinsurgency warfare\\n\\nharkis were mostly used in conventional formations either in allalgerian units commanded by french officers or in mixed units other uses included platoon or smaller size units attached to french battalions in a similar way as the kit carson scouts by the us in vietnam a third use was an intelligence gathering role with some reported minor pseudooperations in support of their intelligence collection58 us military expert lawrence e cline stated the extent of these pseudooperations appears to have been very limited both in time and scope  the most widespread use of pseudo type operations was during the battle of algiers in 1957 the principal french employer of covert agents in algiers was the fifth bureau the psychological warfare branch the fifth bureau made extensive use of turned fln members one such network being run by captain paulalain leger of the 10th paras persuaded to work for the french forces included by the use of torture and threats against their family these agents mingled with fln cadres they planted incriminating forged documents spread false rumors of treachery and fomented distrust  as a frenzy of throatcutting and disemboweling broke out among confused and suspicious fln cadres nationalist slaughtered nationalist from april to september 1957 and did frances work for her59 but this type of operation involved individual operatives rather than organized covert units\\n\\none organized pseudoguerrilla unit however was created in december 1956 by the french dst domestic intelligence agency the organization of the french algerian resistance oraf a group of counterterrorists had as its mission to carry out false flag terrorist attacks with the aim of quashing any hopes of political compromise60 but it seemed that as in indochina the french focused on developing native guerrilla groups that would fight against the fln one of whom fought in the southern atlas mountains equipped by the french army61\\n\\nthe fln also used pseudoguerrilla strategies against the french army on one occasion with force k a group of 1000 algerians who volunteered to serve in force k as guerrillas for the french but most of these members were either already fln members or were turned by the fln once enlisted corpses of purported fln members displayed by the unit were in fact those of dissidents and members of other algerian groups killed by the fln the french army finally discovered the war ruse and tried to hunt down force k members however some 600 managed to escape and join the fln with weapons and equipment6116255–7\\n\\nlate in 1957 general raoul salan commanding the french army in algeria instituted a system of quadrillage surveillance using a grid pattern dividing the country into sectors each permanently garrisoned by troops responsible for suppressing rebel operations in their assigned territory salans methods sharply reduced the instances of fln terrorism but tied down a large number of troops in static defense salan also constructed a heavily patrolled system of barriers to limit infiltration from tunisia and morocco the best known of these was the morice line named for the french defense minister andré morice which consisted of an electrified fence barbed wire and mines over a 320kilometer stretch of the tunisian border\\nthe french military command ruthlessly applied the principle of collective responsibility to villages suspected of sheltering supplying or in any way cooperating with the guerrillas villages that could not be reached by mobile units were subject to aerial bombardment fln guerrillas that fled to caves or other remote hiding places were tracked and hunted down in one episode fln guerrillas who refused to surrender and withdraw from a cave complex were dealt with by french foreign legion pioneer troops who lacking flamethrowers or explosives simply bricked up each cave leaving the residents to die of suffocation62\\n\\nfinding it impossible to control all of algerias remote farms and villages the french government also initiated a program of concentrating large segments of the rural population including whole villages in camps under military supervision to prevent them from aiding the rebels in the three years 1957–60 during which the regroupement program was followed more than 2 million algerians24 were removed from their villages mostly in the mountainous areas and resettled in the plains where it was difficult to reestablish their previous economic and social systems living conditions in the fortified villages were poor in hundreds of villages orchards and croplands not already burned by french troops went to seed for lack of care these population transfers effectively denied the use of remote villages to fln guerrillas who had used them as a source of rations and manpower but also caused significant resentment on the part of the displaced villagers relocations social and economic disruption continued to be felt a generation later\\n\\nthe french army shifted its tactics at the end of 1958 from dependence on quadrillage to the use of mobile forces deployed on massive searchanddestroy missions against fln strongholds in 1959 salans successor general maurice challe appeared to have suppressed major rebel resistance but political developments had already overtaken the french armys successesyet mcclellan and halleck both proved reluctant to take decisive action in the field after the battle of shiloh it took the latter almost a month to advance 20 miles south to attack the vital confederate railroad junction at corinth mississippi lincoln grew so frustrated with mcclellan’s inaction that he responded to the general’s october 1862 request for more horses with an exasperated telegram “i have just read your despatch about sore tongued and fatiegued sic horses will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of antietam that fatigue anything”\\n\\nby contrast grant had never been an enthusiastic student of military art and science even his fiercely loyal lieutenant william t sherman doubted grant’s “knowledge of grand strategy and of books of science and history” he told his friend precisely that in a march 1864 letter in which he also concluded that grant’s triumph owed in large measure to his fundamental “commonsense” and to his “chief characteristic” an unshakeable “faith” in victory that faith was justified by a serendipitous combination of qualities that enabled grant to become one of the most extraordinary military leaders in american history\\ngrant didn’t go in much for doctrine but he brought a relentlessly aggressive approach to warfare he always favored activity and forward movement to standing still even in victory he would be frustrated by subordinates’ failure to pursue the retreating enemythey don’t move they don’t complain and they’re impervious to xray damage in other words mummies are “a perfect subject for medical radiography” according to conservator jp brown of chicago’s field museum of natural history  \\n\\nscientists figured this out early on just months after wilhelm roentgen’s discovery of xrays in the fall of 1895 a physicist walter koenig captured the first radiographic images of mummified remains at the physical society of frankfurtammain up until that point studying mummies had mostly meant unwrapping them a process that brown notes is “necessarily destructive” a few decades later the field museum became a pioneer of mummy imaging edward jerman of the victor xray  corporation of chicago volunteered his services and radiographed 32 ancient egyptian and peruvian mummies in the museum’s collection with what curator berthold lauer called “such gratifying and convincing results” that museum president stanley field opened a division of roentgenology in 1926\\n\\n\\nin 1931 the museum published a radiographic study by paleopathologist roy moodie that captured many of its mummies in vivid skeletal detail including child mummies from egypt and peru and a skull with an outgrowth that moodie diagnosed as a cranial tumor the study also turned up “imitation mummies” made of assorted feathers bones and scraps of skin—believed to have been either created to help guide disintegrated bodies on their journey to the afterlife or assembled by embalmers as a sly attempt to earn extra money\\n\\nalthough xrays allow a noninvasive glimpse into unopened mummies they create distortion by magnifying objects closer to the xray source and they obscure the appearance of soft tissues and textiles when ct scanning which produces highresolution crosssectional images of the body emerged in the 1970s mummy preservation experts quickly realized its potential for revealing ancient mortuary practices\\n\\ncase in point a 2011 ct scan at the field museum revealed wax figurines of the sons of the ancient egyptian god horus bound to individual organ packets stuffed inside the mummy because each of the sons designated certain organs in egyptian culture brown was able to identify the intestines stomach liver and lungs he then used these findings to help identify unknown organ packets in other mummies that didn’t have wax figurines “that was pretty awesome” he says because “apart from flagrant guessing we had no previous methodological basis” for determining organ identity\\n\\nmimi leveque a conservator at the peabody essex museum in salem massachusetts and selfdescribed “mummy doctor” who has collaborated with brown recalls ct scanning an egyptian mummy known as padihershef at massachusetts general hospital in 2013 and seeing it imaged “layer by layer by layer so you could see the face you could see the bones    of the face you could see inside the head    you could still see the brain tissue” ct scanning has also helped leveque design custom housings to support the deteriorated bones of north america’s oldest mummy a roughly 4000yearold specimen from egypt at the michael c carlos museum in atlanta\\n\\ndespite the long history of mummy scanning brown says that many questions remain about ancient mortuary practice that can’t be answered with individual scans he points to archives being developed at the penn museum and the impact mummy database which compile scans of mummies and offer access to researchers who wish to study them as steps toward improving our understanding of both the mummification process and its artifactsde gaulle\\n\\nmany people regardless of citizenship greeted de gaulles return to power as the breakthrough needed to end the hostilities on his trip to algeria on 4 june de gaulle calculatedly made an ambiguous and broad emotional appeal to all the inhabitants declaring je vous ai compris i have understood you de gaulle raised the hopes of the piednoir and the professional military disaffected by the indecisiveness of previous governments with his exclamation of vive lalgérie française long live french algeria to cheering crowds in mostaganem at the same time he proposed economic social and political reforms to improve the situation of the muslims nonetheless de gaulle later admitted to having harbored deep pessimism about the outcome of the algerian situation even then meanwhile he looked for a third force among the population of algeria uncontaminated by the fln or the ultras colon extremists through whom a solution might be found\\n\\nde gaulle immediately appointed a committee to draft a new constitution for frances fifth republic which would be declared early the next year with which algeria would be associated but of which it would not form an integral part all muslims including women were registered for the first time on electoral rolls to participate in a referendum to be held on the new constitution in september 1958\\n\\nde gaulles initiative threatened the fln with decreased support among muslims in reaction the fln set up the provisional government of the algerian republic gouvernement provisoire

morocco tunisia china and several other african arab and asian countries but not by the soviet union\\n\\nin february 1959 de gaulle was elected president of the new fifth republic he visited constantine in october to announce a program to end the war and create an algeria closely linked to france de gaulles call on the rebel leaders to end hostilities and to participate in elections was

countrys strongest political forces which was supporting the algerian revolution thousands of relatives of conscripts and reserve soldiers suffered loss and pain revelations of torture and the indiscriminate brutality the army visited on the muslim population prompted widespread revulsion and a significant constituency supported the principle of national liberation by 1959 it was clear that the status quo was untenable and france could either grant algeria independence or allow real equality with the muslims de gaulle told an advisor if we integrate them if all the arabs and the berbers of algeria were considered french how could they be prevented from settling in france where the living standard is so much higher my village would no longer be called colombeylesdeuxéglises but colombeylesdeuxmosquées63 international pressure was also building on france to grant algeria independence since 1955 the un general assembly annually considered the algerian question and the fln position was gaining support frances seeming intransigence in settling a colonial war that tied down half the manpower of its armed forces was also a source of concern to its north atlantic treaty organization allies in a 16 september 1959 statement de gaulle dramatically reversed his stand and uttered the words selfdetermination as the third and preferred solution 5 which he envisioned as leading to majority rule in an algeria formally associated with france in tunis abbas acknowledged that de gaulles statement might be accepted as a basis for settlement but the french government

complete crushing of the rebels – we will have put an end to the fighting when after a prolonged period of appeasement the population will have become conscious of the stakes and thanks to us realised the necessary progress in political economic social educational and other domains then it will be the algerians who will tell us what they want to be your french of algeria how can you listen to the liars and the conspirators who tell you that if you grant free choice to the algerians france and de gaulle want to abandon you retreat from algeria and deliver you to the rebellion i say to all of

the selfdetermination of algeria on 8 january 1961 which 75 of the voters both in france and algeria approved and de gaulles government began secret peace negotiations with the fln in the algerian départements 6951 voted in favor of selfdetermination73 the talks that began in march 1961 broke down when de gaulle insisted on including the much smaller mouvement national algérien mna which the fln objected to74 since the fln was the by far stronger movement with the mna almost wiped out by this time the french were finally forced to exclude the mna from the talks after the fln walked out for a time7488\\n\\nthe generals putsch in april 1961 aimed at canceling the governments negotiations with the fln marked the turning point in the official attitude toward the algerian war leading the coup attempt to depose de gaulle were general raoul salan general andré zeller general maurice challe and general edmond jouhaud7487–97 only the paratroop divisions and the foreign legion joined the coup while the air force navy and most of the army stayed loyal to general de gaulle but at one moment de gaulle went on french television to ask for public support with the normally lofty de gaulle saying frenchmen frenchwomen help me7489 de gaulle was now prepared to abandon the piedsnoirs which no previous french government was willing to do the army had been discredited by the putsch and kept a low profile politically throughout the rest of frances involvement with algeria the oas was to be the main standard bearer for the piedsnoirs for the rest of the war\\ntalks with the fln reopened at évian in may 1961 after several false starts the french government decreed that a ceasefire would take effect on march 18 1962 a major difficulty at the talks was de gaulles decision to grant independence only to the coastal regions of algeria where the bulk of the population lived while hanging onto the sahara which happened to be rich in oil and gas while the fln claimed all of algeria74 during the talks the piednoir and muslim communities engaged in a low level civil war with bombings shootings throatcutting and assassinations being the preferred methods7490 the canadian historian john cairns wrote at times it seemed like both communities were going berserk as everyday murder was indiscriminate7490 on 29 june 1961 de gaulle announced on tv that fighting was virtually finished and afterwards there was no major fighting between the french army and the fln during the summer of 1961 the oas and the fln engaged in a civil war in which the greater number of the muslims soon made a difference7490 to pressure de gaulle to abandon his demand to keep the sahara the fln organized demonstrations in france from algerians living there in the fall of 1961 which the french police crushed7491 it was in the course of crushing one demonstration that a massacre of algerians on 17 october 1961 which was ordered by maurice papon took place on 10 january 1962 the fln started a general offensive against the oas staging a series on the piednoir communities as a way of applying pressure7491 on 7 february 1962 the oas attempted to assassinate the culture minister andré malraux by setting off a bomb in his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target but did leave a fouryear girl living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel75 the blinding of the girl did much to turn french opinion against the oas\\n\\non 20 february 1962 a peace accord was reached for granting independence to all of algeria7487 in their final form the évian accords allowed the piedsnoirs equal legal protection with algerians over a threeyear period these rights included respect for property participation in public affairs and a full range of civil and cultural rights at the end of that period however all algerian residents would be obliged to become algerian citizens or be classified as aliens with the attendant loss of rights the agreement also allowed france to establish military bases in algeria even after independence including the nuclear test site of regghane the naval base of merselkebir and the air base of bou sfer and to have privileges visàvis algerian oil the oas started a campaign of spectacular terrorist attacks to sabotage the évian accords hoping that if enough muslims were killed a general pogrom against the piedsnoirs would break out leading the french army to turn its guns against the government7487 despite ample provocation with oas lobbing mortar shells into the casbah of algiers the fln gave orders for no retaliatory attacks7487 in the spring of 1962 the oas turned to bank robbery to finance its war against both the fln and the french state and bombed special units sent by paris to hunt them down7493 only eighty deputies voted against the évian accords in the national assembly and cairns wrote the fulminations of jeanmarie le pen against de gaulle were only the traditional verbal excesses of thirdrate firebrands without a substantial following and without a constructive idea74\\n\\nfollowing the cease fire tensions developed between the piednoir community and their former protectors in the french army an oas ambush of french conscripts on 20 march was followed by 20000 gendarmes and troops being ordered to occupy the major piednoir district of babeloued in algiers16524 a week later frenchofficered muslim tirailleurs panicked and opened fire on a crowd of piednoir demonstrators in the centre of the city76 total casualties in these three incidents were 326 dead and wounded amongst the piednoir and 110 french military personnel16524–5 a journalist who saw the shootings on 26 march 1962 henry tanner described the scene when the shooting stopped the street was littered with bodies of women as well as men dead wounded or dying the black pavement looked grey as if bleached by fire crumpled french flags were lying in pools of blood shattered glass and spent cartridges were everywhere7494 a number of shocked piedsnoirs screamed that they were not french anymore7495 one woman screamed stop firing my god were french before she was shot down7495 the massacre served to greatly embitter the piednoir community and led to a massive surge of support for the oas7495\\n\\nin the second referendum on the independence of algeria held in april 1962 91 percent of the french electorate approved the evian accords on 1 july 1962 some 6 million of a total algerian electorate of 65 million cast their ballots the vote was nearly unanimous with 5992115 votes for independence 16534 against with most piedsnoirs and harkis either having fled or abstaining77 de gaulle pronounced algeria an independent country on 3 july the provisional executive however proclaimed 5 july the 132nd anniversary of the french entry into algeria as the day of national independence\\n\\nduring the three months between the ceasefire and the french referendum on algeria the oas unleashed a new campaign the oas sought to provoke a major breach in the ceasefire by the fln but the attacks now were aimed also against the french army and police enforcing the accords as well as against muslims it was the most wanton carnage that algeria had witnessed in eight years of savage warfare oas operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in march with targets including hospitals and schools\\n\\nduring the summer of 1962 a rush of piedsnoirs fled to france within a year 14 million refugees including almost the entire jewish community had joined the exodus despite the declaration of independence on 5 july 1962 the last french forces did not leave the naval base of mers el kébir until 1967 the evian accords had permitted france to maintain its military presence for fifteen years so the withdrawal in 1967 was significantly ahead of schedule16 cairns writing from paris in 1962 declared in some ways the last year has been the worse tension has never been higher disenchantment in france at least has never been greater the mindless cruelty of it all has never been more absurd and savage this last year stretching from the hopeful spring of 1961 to the ceasefire of 18 march 1962 spanned a season of shadow boxing false threats capitulation and murderous hysteria french algeria died badly its agony was marked by panic and brutality as ugly as the record of european imperialism could show in the spring of 1962 the unhappy corpse of empire still shuddered and lashed out and stained itself in fratricide the whole episode of its death measured at least seven and half years constituted perhaps the most pathetic and sordid event in the entire history of colonialism it is hard to see how anybody of importance in the tangled web of the conflict came out looking well nobody won the conflict nobody dominated it7487algerian use of terror\\n\\nspecializing in ambushes and night raids to avoid direct contact with superior french firepower the internal forces targeted army patrols military encampments police posts and colonial farms mines and factories as well as transportation and communications facilities kidnapping was commonplace as was the murder and mutilation of civilians55 at first the fln targeted only muslim officials of the colonial regime later they coerced maimed or killed village elders government employees and even simple peasants who refused to support them throat slitting and decapitation were commonly used by the fln as mechanisms of terror16134–5 during the first two and a half years of the conflict the guerrillas killed an estimated 6352 muslim and 1035 nonmuslim civilians16135historiography\\n\\nalthough the opening of the archives of the ministry of foreign affairs after a 30year lockup enabled some new historical research on the war including jeancharles jauffrets book la guerre dalgérie par les documents the algerian war according to the documents many remain inaccessible106 the recognition in 1999 by the national assembly permitted the algerian war at last to enter the syllabi of french schools in france the war was known as la guerre sans nom the war without a name while it was being fought as the government variously described the war as the algerian events the algerian problem and the algerian dispute the mission of the french army was ensuring security maintaining order and pacification but was never described as fighting a war while the fln were referred to as criminals bandits outlaws terrorists and fellagha a derogatory arabic word meaning roadcutters but which was popularly mistranslated as throatcuttersa reference to the flns favorite method of execution namely making people wear the kabylian smile by cutting their throats pulling their tongues out and leaving them to bleed to death107 after reports of the widespread use of torture by french forces started to reach france in 1956–57 the war become commonly known as la sale guerre the dirty war a term that is still used today and which reflects the very negative memory of the war in france107145\\n\\nas the war was officially a police action for decades no monuments were built to honor the about 25000 french soldiers killed in the war while the defense ministry refused to classify veterans as veterans until the 1970s54219 when a monument to the unknown soldier of the algerian war was erected in 1977 the french president valéry giscard destaing in his dedication speech refused to use the words war or algeria instead using the phrase the unknown soldier of north africa54219 a national monument to the french war dead was not built until 1996 and even then spoke only of those killed fighting in afrique du nord and was located in a decrepit area of paris rarely visited by tourists as if to hide the monument54226 further adding to the silence were the vested interests of french politicians françois mitterrand the socialist president 1981–95 had been the interior minister 1954–55 and the justice minister 1955–57 during which time he had been deeply involved in the repression of the fln and it was only after mitterrands death in 1996 that socialists started to become willing to talk about the war and even then remaining very guarded about mitterrands role54232 likewise de gaulle had promised in the evian accords that the piedsnoirs could remain in algeria but after independence the fln had freely violated the accords leading to the entire piednoir population fleeing to france usually with only the clothes they were wearing as they had lost everything they had in algeria54232 for gaullists this was not exactly a shining moment to cherish54232\\n\\nin english british and american historians tended to see the fln as freedom fighters with the french being condemned as imperialists108 one of the first books about the war in english a scattering of dust by american journalist herb greer depicted the algerian struggle for independence in a very sympathetic way108220–1 most work in english done in the 1960s and 1970s usually the work of leftwing scholars focused on explaining the fln as a part of a generational change in algerian nationalism and depicted the war as either a reaction to intolerable racist oppression andor an attempt by peasantry impoverished by french policies to improve their lot108222–5 one of the few military histories of the war was the algerian insurrection by a retired british army officer edgar oballance who wrote with frank admiration for french tactics in algeria seeing the fln as a terrorist group that needed to be suppressed and concluded that the tactics that won the war militarily lost the war politically108225–6\\n\\nin 1977 the british historian alistair horne published a savage war of peace which is generally regarded as the leading book written on the subject in english though written from a french perspective rather the algerian108226 after 15 years horne was not concerned about right or wrong but with cause and effect108217–35 a francophile who lived in paris at the time of the war horne had condemned the suez war and the french bombing of the tunisian village of sakiet sidi youssef in 1958 arguing that the inflexibility of the fln had won algeria independence and created a sense of algerian national identity leading to rule by authoritarian but progressive fln regime108217–35 the american journalist adam shatz wrote not surprisingly the best single survey of the war is by an english journalist alistair horne whose masterful a savage war of peace published in 1977 still has no equal in french63\\n\\nin a 1977 column published in the times literacy supplement reviewing the book a savage war of peace by alistair horne the iraqiborn british historian elie kedourie vigorously attacked horne as an apologist for terrorism accusing him of engaging the cosy pieties of bienpensants as kedorie condemned those western intellectuals who excused terrorism when committed by third world revolutionaries108217–35 kedourie claimed that far from a mass movement the fln were a small gang of murderous intellectuals who used brutally terroristic tactics against the french and any muslim who was loyal to the french whom the french had beaten back by 1959108217–235 kedourie charged that de gaulle had cynically sacrificed the colons and the harkis as kedourie charged that de gaulle had chosen to disregard his constitutional oath as president to protect all the french to ensure that the french withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scenea civilized government thus acting for all the world like the votary of some mao or ho in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun108227\\n\\nbefore the war algeria was a favored setting for french films with the british french professor leslie hill having written in the late 1920s and 1930s for instance north africa provided filmmakers in france with a ready fund of familiar images of the exotics mingling for instance the languid eroticism of arabian nights with the infinite and hazy vistas of the sahara to create a powerful confection of tragic heroism and passionate love107147 during the war itself french censors banned the entire subject of the war107147–8 since 1962 when film censorship relating to the war eased french films dealing with the conflict have consistently portrayed the war as a set of conflicting memories and rival narratives of which only some may be true but which ones is left unclear with most films dealing with the war taking a disjointed chronological structure where scenes before during and after the war are juxtaposed out of sequence with one film critic referring to the cinematic algeria as an ambiguous world marked by the displacements and repetitions of dreams107142–58 the consistent message of french films dealing with the war is that something horrible happened but just what happened who was involved and why being left unexplained107142–158 though atrocities especially torture by french forces are acknowledged the french soldiers who fought in algeria were and are always portrayed in french cinema as the lost soldiers tragic victims of the war who are more deserving of sympathy than the fln people they tortured almost invariably portrayed as vicious psychopathic terrorists – an approach to the war that has raised anger in algeria107151–6\\n\\nfrom time to time the memory of the algerian war surfaced in france in 1987 when sshauptsturmführer klaus barbie the butcher of lyon was brought to trial for crimes against humanity graffiti appeared on the walls of the banlieues the slum districts in which most algerian immigrants in france live in reading barbie in france when will massu be in algeria54230 barbies lawyer jacques vergès adopted a tu quoque defense asking the judges is a crime against humanity is to be defined as only one of nazis against the jews or if it applies to more seriously crimesthe crimes of imperialists against people struggling for their independence going on to say there was nothing his client did against the french resistance that was not done by certain french officers in algeria whom vergès noted could not be prosecuted because of de gaulles amnesty of 196254230 in 1997 when maurice papon a career french civil servant was brought to trial for crimes against humanity for sending 1 600 jews from bordeaux to be killed at auschwitz in 1942 it emerged over the course of the trial that on 17 october 1961 papon had organized a massacre of between 100 and 200 algerians in central paris which was the first time that most of the french had heard of the massacre54231 the revelation that hundreds of people had been killed by the paris sûreté was a great shock in france and led to uncomfortable questions being raised about what had happened during the algerian war54231 the american historian william cohen wrote that the papon trial sharpened the focus on the algerian war it not provide clarity as papons role as a civil servant under vichy led to misleading conclusions in france that it was former collaborators who were responsible for the terror in algeria when in fact most of the men responsible like guy mollet general marcel bigeard robert lacoste general jacques massu and jacques soustelle had all been résistants in world war two which was a fact that many french historians found very unpalatable54231\\n\\nin 1992 the american john ruedy published modern algeria origins and development of a nation108232–3 ruedy wrote under french rule the traditional social structure had been so completely destroyed that when the fln launched its independence struggle in 1954 the only way of asserting ones interests was the law of the gun which explains why the fln was so violent not only in regards to its enemies but also within the movement forming the basis of an alternative political culture based on brute force that persists to this day108233\\n\\non 15 june 2000 le monde published an interview with louisette ighilahriz a former fln member who described in graphic detail her torture at the hands of the french army and made the sensational claim that the war heroes general jacques massu and general marcel bigeard had personally been present when she being tortured for information54233 what made the interview very touching for many french people was that ighilahriz was not demanding vengeance but rather wished to express thanks to dr françois richaud the army doctor who extended her much kindness and whom she believed saved her life by treating her every time she was tortured asking if it were possible for her to see dr richaud one last time to thank him personally dr richaud it turned out had died in 199754233 as ighilahriz had been an attractive woman in her youth universityeducated secular fluent in french and fond of quoting victor hugo and her duties in the fln had been as an information courier she made for a most sympathetic victim as she was a woman did not come across as algerian54234 william cohen commented had she been an uneducated man who had been involved in killings and was not coming forward to express thanks for a frenchman her story might not had resonated the same way54234 the ighiahriz case led to a public letter signed by 12 people who been involved in the war to president chirac asking that october 31 be made a public day of remembrance for victims of torture in algeria54234 in response to the ighilahriz case general paul aussaresses gave an interview on 23 november 2000 in which he candidly admitted to ordering torture and extrajudicial executions stating he had personally executed 24 fellagha which he argued were justified as torture and extrajudicial executions were the only way to defeat the fln54235 in may 2001 general aussaresses published his memoirs services spéciaux algérie 1955–1957 in which presented a detailed account of torture and extrajudicial killings in the name of the republic which he wrote were all done under orders from paris confirming what had been long suspected54239 as a result of these interviews and aussaressess book the algerian war was finally extensively discussed by the french media who had ignored the subject as much as possible for decades through no consensus emerged about how to best remember the war54235 adding to the interest was the decision by one war veteran georges fogel to come forward to confirm that he had seen ighiahriz and many others tortured in 1957 while the politician and war veteran jean marie faure decided in february 2001 to release extracts from the diary he kept at the time showing acts of sadism and horror he had witnessed54235 the french historian pierre vidalnaquet called this a moment of catharsis that was explainable only in nearfrench terms it is the return of the repressed54235–6\\n\\nin 2002 une vie debout mémoires politiques by mohammed harbi a former advisor to ben bella was published in which harbi wrote because they the fln leaders werent supported at the moment of their arrival on the scene by a real and dynamic popular movement they took power of the movement by force and they maintained it by force convinced that they had to act with resolution in order to protect themselves against their enemies they deliberately chose an authoritarian path63\\n\\nthe algerian war remains a contentious event today according to historian benjamin stora one of the leading historians on the algerian war memories concerning the war remain fragmented with no common ground to speak of\\n\\nthere is no such thing as a history of the algerian war there is just a multitude of histories and personal paths through it everyone involved considers that they lived through it in their own way and any attempt to understand the algerian war globally is immediately rejected by protagonists109\\n\\neven though stora has counted 3000 publications in french on the algerian war there still is no work produced by french and algerian authors cooperating with one another even though according to stora there can no longer be talk about a war without a name a number of problems remain especially the absence of sites in france to commemorate the war furthermore conflicts have arisen on an exact commemoration date to end the war although many sources as well as the french state place it on 19 march 1962 the evian agreements others point out that the massacres of harkis and the kidnapping of piedsnoirs took place afterwards stora further points out the phase of memorial reconciliation between the two sides of the sea is still a long way off109 this was evidenced by the national assemblys creation of the law on colonialism on 23 february 2005 which asserted that colonialism had overall been positive\\n\\nalongside a heated debate in france the february 23 2005 law had the effect of jeopardizing the treaty of friendship that president jacques chirac was supposed to sign with president abdelaziz bouteflika—a treaty no longer on the agenda following this controversial law bouteflika has talked about a cultural genocide particularly referring to the 1945 sétif massacre chirac finally had the law repealed through a complex institutional mechanism\\n\\nanother matter concerns the teaching of the war as well as of colonialism and decolonization in particular in french secondary schools110 hence there is only one reference to racism in a french textbook one published by bréal publishers for terminales students those passing their baccalauréat thus many are not surprised that the first to speak about the october 17 1961 massacre were music bands including but not only hiphop bands such as the famous suprême ntm les arabes dans la seine or politically engaged la rumeur indeed the algerian war is not even the subject of a specific chapter in textbook for terminales106 henceforth benjamin stora stated\\n\\nas algerians do not appear in an indigenous condition and their subcitizens status as the history of nationalist movement is never evoked as their being one of great figures of the resistance such as messali hadj and ferhat abbas they neither emerge nor are being given attention no one is explaining to students what colonization has been we have prevented students from understanding why the decolonization took place106\\n\\nin metropolitan france in 1963 43 of french algerians lived in bidonvilles shanty towns111 thus azouz begag the delegate minister for equal opportunities wrote an autobiographic novel le gone du chaâba about his experiences while living in a bidonville in the outskirts of lyon it is impossible to understand the thirdgeneration of algerian immigrants to france without recalling this bicultural experience an official parliamentary report on the prevention of criminality commanded by then interior minister villepin and made by member of parliament jacquesalain bénisti claimed that multilingualism bilinguisme was a factor of criminality sic112 following outcries the definitive version of the bénisti report finally made multilingualism an asset rather than a fault113\\n\\nafter having denied its use for 40 years the french state has finally recognized its history of torture although there was never an official proclamation about it general paul aussaresses was sentenced following his justification of the use of torture for apology of war crimes but as it did during wartime the french state claimed torture were isolated acts instead of admitting its responsibility for the frequent use of torture to break the insurgents morale and not as aussaresses has claimed to save lives by gaining shortterm information which would stop terrorists114 the state now claims that torture was a regrettable aberration due to the context of the exceptionally savage war but academic research has proven both theses false torture in algeria was engraved in the colonial act it is a normal illustration of an abnormal system wrote nicolas bancel pascal blanchard and sandrine lemaire who discuss the phenomena of human zoos115 from the enfumades smoking parlors of the darha caves in 1844 by pélissier to the 1945 riots in sétif guelma and kherrata the repression in algeria has used the same methods following the sétif massacres other riots against the european presence occurred in guelma batna biskra and kherrata they resulted in 103 deaths among the piedsnoirs the suppression of these riots officially saw 1500 other deaths but n bancel p blanchard and s lemaire estimate the number to be between 6000 and 8000116how the algerian war shaped french cities\\n\\nthe algerian war of independence which coincided with a turning point in france’s urban history had a significant influence on the future of french cities metropolitics explores the role of conflict in their development\\n\\nthe second half of the 1950s was a crucial period of change in the history of french urban policy it was at this time that urban renewal slum clearance and the construction of large social housing estates began and yet these policies were implemented while the country was at war – even if the colonial conflict in algeria was never officially designated as such recent research has shown that this context of war was a decisive factor in the orientation of these public policies which would indelibly mark the appearance and population of french cities as well as the administrative practices involved in managing these urban areas to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the conflict metropolitics explores in this series of articles the algerian origins of modern french cities which are so often forgotten as a result of limited crossover between the disciplines of urban studies and the history of the algerian war\\n\\nthe war led to considerable levels of migration from algeria to mainland france which raised the question of how to accommodate these migrant populations as the conflict came to an end the french government had to find solutions to house its repatriated citizens whose experience would be different from those of other population groups while the arrival in 1962 of 600000 piedsnoirs 1 – which led in no small part to the radical modification of certain french cities – incited intense homebuilding operations a large proportion of the 90000 harkis 2 evacuated to france were for a long time housed in isolated areas the war also led to an increase in the numbers of “french muslims from algeria” as the french administration called them following the statute of 1945 that gave them french citizenship whose presence in mainland france concerned the public authorities they were the targets of the forced enrolment policies of the two major – and rival – separatist parties namely the fln front de libération nationale or national liberation front and the mna mouvement national algérien or national algerian movement controlling these groups was therefore an important police objective during the war this meant controlling the places where they lived which were both concentrated and segregated areas of algerian housing in mainland france thus became the subject of specific measures implemented by the various forces of order\\n\\nfor the french administration these strategies sought to simultaneously dismantle what appeared to be rear bases for the fln control the populations concerned and educate these populations or “integrate” them into mainland life numerous urban planning and housing policies were put into place to meet this triple objective the clearance of bidonvilles shanty towns the renovation of former slum neighbourhoods the creation of cités de transit temporary settlements for families the construction of workers’ hostels for single migrants and the drafting of de facto rules for the allocation of social housing in large purposebuilt estates in implementing these urban policies priorities in terms of policing and urban and social projects were intimately linked during this period military history converged with the history of urban planning and that of social policy and not only created the conditions necessary for the implementation of such policies but also influenced the policies themselves\\n\\nthe algerian conflict also explains the observable continuities between colonial and mainland practices in terms of settlement patterns and the way in which certain population groups were controlled moreover one of the major developments in recent research lies in the uncovering of this link for example the bidonville clearance operations in colonial cities and mainland cities would appear to have a common colonial ancestry that goes back to experiences in the 1930s if not further still this recycling of practices was possible as a result of administrative structures that were inspired by one another as well as the circulation of colonial civil servants who were recruited as expert advisors for the implementation of policies intended to control and educate algerians recently arrived on the mainland indeed many of those responsible for social urban and policing policies in mainland france during and after the war began their careers in the colonial administration the two most emblematic cases are without doubt maurice papon who was appointed prefect of police head of the paris police with many responsibilities currently held by the city mayor in 1958 after heading the prefecture of constantine and paul delouvrier who prior to supervising the planning and development of the paris region and the creation of the new towns programme in france from 1961 onwards implemented the constantine plan in his capacity as delegategeneral of the government in algeria from 1958 to 1961 intended to organise the development of algeria including the creation of “new villages”\\n\\nthe longterm influence of the algerian war of independence on urban policy in mainland france is the second major development in recent research it was primarily because the bidonvilles in mainland france were populated by algerians that action was taken to eradicate them furthermore policing priorities had an influence on the way their inhabitants were rehoused moreover the practices devised at this time to deal with bidonvilles continued to be applied after the war the demolition of the portuguese shanty towns at champignysurmarne in the eastern suburbs of paris utilised the very same methods similarly the notion of maximum quotas for certain population groups in social housing schemes originally applied to algerians continued to be used by social landlords and applied to all immigrant populations measures put in place to house algerians – the cités de transit and workers’ hostels – which promoted acculturation a school of thought that also characterised colonial settlement policies would also continue long after the end of the war in light of this it is therefore clear that french housing policies targeting immigrant populations today are strongly marked by the context of their creation – namely the algerian war at a time when this conflict is being commemorated in french cities with the installation of plaques and the renaming of streets and squares it seems apt to take stock of this heritagein april 1862 during the bloody twoday battle of shiloh grant did not share his colleagues’ bleak view sherman was demoralized by the first day’s fighting while don carlos buell who arrived with reinforcements in the midst of the battle advised retreat grant refused “the distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front” he asserts in his memoirs by the next day he continues “we had now become the attacking party the enemy was driven back all day as we had been the day before until finally he beat a precipitate retreat” in may 1864 after fighting to a costly stalemate in his first battle with robert e lee at the wilderness in virginia grant surprised and delighted the union army of the potomac by not retreating as they had done so many times before under different commanders “most of us thought…that the next day we should recross the river” a captain in a massachusetts regiment remembered “but when the order came ‘by the left flank march’ we found that grant was not made that way and we must continue the fight” sherman likewise celebrated grant’s decision “when grant cried ‘forward’ after the battle of the wilderness i said ‘this is the grandest act of his life now i feel that the rebellion will be crushed’ i wrote him saying it was a bold order to give andit showed the me\\nhe believed in success—but didn’t romanticize the means to achieving it\\n\\nwhat sherman called grant’s “simple faith in success” proved infectious his confidence and determination made others believe in themselves as well “when you have completed your best preparations you go into battle without hesitationno doubts no reserve” sherman wrote to grant “i tell you that it was this that made us act with confidence i knew wherever i was that you thought of me and if i got in a tight place you would come—if alive”\\n\\nbut grant was no mystic nor was he reckless his confidence was rooted in an unswerving sense of purpose an unflappable nature an ability to delegate responsibility as opposed to micromanaging and knowledge gained by cool and careful observation over the years in the mexican war he studied two commanders in action winfield scott and zachary taylor whose nicknames—“old fuss and feathers” and “old rough and ready”—encapsulate their antithetical styles from taylor who always “put his meaning so plainly there could be no mistaking it” grant learned the importance of clear and direct communication\\n\\nit was in mexico while serving as regimental quartermaster and involving himself in as many battles as he could that grant had learned the decidedly unromantic aspects of war the ingenuity required to feed and supply an army the hazards of poor camp sanitation the value of different kinds of expertise and the unequivocal brutality of combat in the last year of the civil war as casualties mounted and the horrors of trench warfare accumulated in the battles of cold harbor and petersburg grant remained fixed in his

as late antique or byzantine architecture almost no substantial examples survive from before about 100 bc and most of the major survivals are from the later empire after about 100 ad roman architectural style continued to influence building in the former empire for many centuries and the style used in western europe beginning about 1000 is called romanesque architecture to reflect this dependence on basic roman forms\\n\\nthe romans only began to achieve significant originality in architecture around the beginning of the imperial period after they had combined aspects of their original etruscan architecture with others taken from greece including most elements of the style we now call classical architecture they moved from trabeated construction mostly based on columns and lintels to one based on massive walls punctuated by arches and later domes both of which greatly developed under the romans the classical orders now became largely decorative rather than structural except in colonnades stylistic developments included the tuscan and composite orders the first being a shortened simplified variant on the doric order and the composite being a tall order with the floral decoration of the corinthian and the scrolls of the ionic the period from roughly 40 bc to about 230 ad saw most of the greatest achievements before the crisis of the third century and later troubles reduced the wealth and organizing power of the central government\\n\\nthe romans produced massive public buildings and works of civil engineering and were responsible for significant developments in housing and public hygiene for example their public and private baths and latrines underfloor heating in the form of the hypocaust mica glazing examples in ostia antica and piped hot and cold water examples in pompeii and ostiaroman forum\\n\\nthe roman forum also known by its latin name forum romanum italian foro romano is a rectangular forum plaza surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of rome citizens of the ancient city referred to this space originally a marketplace as the forum magnum or simply the forum\\n\\nfor centuries the forum was the center of daytoday life in rome the site of triumphal processions and elections the venue for public speeches criminal trials and gladiatorial matches and the nucleus of commercial affairs here statues and monuments commemorated the citys great men the teeming heart of ancient rome it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world and in all history1 located in the small valley between the palatine and capitoline hills the forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 45 million or more sightseers yearly2\\n\\nmany of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the forum the roman kingdoms earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge these included the ancient former royal residence the regia 8th century bc and the temple of vesta 7th century bc as well as the surrounding complex of the vestal virgins all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial rome\\n\\nother archaic shrines to the northwest such as the umbilicus urbis and the vulcanal shrine of vulcan developed into the republics formal comitium assembly area this is where the senate—as well as republican government itself—began the senate house government offices tribunals temples memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area\\n\\nover time the archaic comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new basilica aemilia 179 bc some 130 years later julius caesar built the basilica julia along with the new curia julia refocusing both the judicial offices and the senate itself this new forum in what proved to be its final form then served as a revitalized city square where the people of rome could gather for commercial political judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers\\n\\neventually much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the forum romanum to the larger and more extravagant structures trajans forum and the basilica ulpia to the north the reign of constantine the great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the forum complex—the basilica of maxentius 312 ad this returned the political center to the forum until the fall of the western roman empire almost two centuries later\\n\\nunlike the later imperial fora in rome—which were selfconsciously modelled on the ancient greek plateia πλατεῖα public plaza or town square—the roman forum developed gradually organically and piecemeal over many centuries3 this is the case despite attempts with some success to impose some order there by sulla julius caesar augustus and others by the imperial period the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the open area to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 meters4\\n\\nits long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the capitoline hill to that of the velian hill the forums basilicas during the imperial period—the basilica aemilia on the north and the basilica julia on the south—defined its long sides and its final form the forum proper included this square the buildings facing it and sometimes an additional area the forum adjectum extending southeast as far as the arch of titus5\\n\\noriginally the site of the forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained6 this was drained by the tarquins with the cloaca maxima7 because of its location sediments from both the flooding of the tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the forum floor for centuries excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early republican times8\\n\\nas the ground around buildings rose residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove its final travertine paving still visible dates from the reign of augustus excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another the deepest level excavated was 360 meters above sea level archaeological finds show human activity at that level with the discovery of carbonized woodcitation needed\\n\\nan important function of the forum during both republican and imperial times was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as triumphs victorious generals entered the city by the western triumphal gate porta triumphalis and circumnavigated the palatine hill counterclockwise before proceeding from the velian hill down the via sacra and into the forum9\\n\\nfrom here they would mount the capitoline rise clivus capitolinus up to the temple of jupiter optimus maximus on the summit of the capitol lavish public banquets ensued back down on the forum9 in addition to the via sacra the forum was accessed by a number of storied roads and streets including the vicus jugarius vicus tuscus

egypt ancient egyptian civilization followed prehistoric egypt and coalesced around 3100 bc according to conventional egyptian chronology1 with the political unification of upper and lower egypt under menes often identified with narmer2 the history of ancient egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms separated by periods of relative instability known as intermediate periods the old kingdom of

egypt until 30 bc when under cleopatra it fell to the roman empire and became a roman province3\\n\\nthe success of ancient egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the nile river valley for agriculture the predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture with resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and a military intended to assert egyptian dominance motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of a pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs4\\n\\nthe many achievements of the ancient egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks a system of mathematics a practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats5 egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the hittites6 ancient egypt has left a lasting legacy its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries a newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by europeans and egyptians led to the scientific investigation of egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy7\\nhistory\\n\\nthe nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history8 the fertile floodplain of the nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization9 nomadic modern human huntergatherers began living in the nile valley through the end of the middle pleistocene some 120000 years ago by the late paleolithic period the arid climate of northern africa became increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region\\n\\nin predynastic and early

prolific in all environs and the nile region supported large populations of waterfowl hunting would have been common for egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated10\\n\\nby about 5500 bc small tribes living in the nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads the largest of these early cultures in upper southern egypt was the badarian culture which probably originated in the western desert

imported obsidian from ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes13 in naqada ii times early evidence exists of contact with the near east particularly canaan and the byblos coast14 over a period of about 1000 years the naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the nile valley15 establishing a power center at nekhen in greek hierakonpolis and later at abydos naqada iii leaders expanded their control of egypt northwards along the nile16 they also traded with

naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personaluse items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory they also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the roman period to decorate cups amulets and figurines18 during the last predynastic phase the naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient egyptian language19early dynastic period  3050–2686 bc\\n\\nthe early dynastic period was approximately contemporary to the early sumerianakkadian civilisation of mesopotamia and of ancient elam the thirdcentury bc egyptian priest manetho grouped the long line of kings from menes to his own time into 30 dynasties a system still used today he began his official history with the king named meni or menes in greek who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of upper and lower egypt20\\n\\nthe transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient egyptian writers represented and there is no contemporary record of menes some scholars now believe however that the mythical menes may have been the king narmer who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial narmer palette in a symbolic act of unification22 in the early dynastic period which began about 3000 bc the first of the dynastic kings solidified control over lower egypt by establishing a capital at memphis from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the levant the increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at abydos which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death23 the strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land labour and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient egyptian civilization24\\n\\nold kingdom 2686–2181 bc\\nmain article old kingdom of egypt\\nmajor advances in architecture art and technology were made during the old kingdom fueled by the increased

constructed during the old kingdom under the direction of the vizier state officials collected taxes coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield drafted peasants to work on construction projects and established a justice system to maintain peace and order26\\n\\nwith the rising importance of central administration in egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of egypt and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration27 as the power of the kings diminished regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king this coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150

leaders owing no tribute to the king used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces once in control of their own resources the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes30 in bursts of creativity provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the old kingdom and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period31\\n\\nfree from their loyalties to the king local rulers began competing with each

last great ruler of the middle kingdom amenemhat iii allowed semiticspeaking canaanite settlers from the near east into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns these ambitious building and mining activities however combined with severe nile floods later in his reign strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the

the pyramids were not enslaved people but peasants working on the pyramids during the farming offseason these peasants worked alongside specialists like stone cutters mathematicians and priests as a form of taxation each household was required to provide a worker for these projects although the wealthy could pay for a substitute this demonstrates both the power of the state to force people to provide labor and also the advantages enjoyed by elites who could buy their way out of providing labor\\negyptians also began to build ships constructed of wooden planks tied together with rope and

million years ago with modern humans dispersing out of africa about 100000 years ago egypt may have been used to reach asia in some of these migrations \\n\\nvillages dependent on agriculture began to appear in egypt about 7000 years ago and the civilization’s earliest written inscriptions date back about 5200 years they discuss the early rulers of egypt these early rulers include iryhor who according to recently discovered inscriptions founded memphis a city that served as egypt’s capital for much of its history when and how egypt was united is unclear and is a matter of debate among archaeologists and historians  \\n\\negypt’s climate was much wetter in prehistoric times than it is today this means that some areas that are now barren desert were fertile one famous archaeological site where this can be seen is at the cave of swimmers as it is called today on the gilf kebir plateau in southwest egypt the cave is now surrounded by miles of barren desert however it has rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming the exact date of the rock art is unclear although scholars think that it was created in prehistoric times  \\n\\negypts 30 dynasties\\negypt’s history has traditionally been divided into 30 sometimes 31 dynasties this tradition started with the egyptian priest manetho who lived during the third century bc his accounts of ancient egyptian history were preserved by ancient greek writers and until the deciphering of hieroglyphic writing in the 19th century were one of the few historical accounts that scholars could read \\n\\nmodernday scholars often group these dynasties into several periods dynasties one and two date back around 5000 years and are often called the early dynastic or archaic period the first pharaoh of the first dynasty was a ruler named menes or narmer as he is called in greek he lived over 5000 years ago and while ancient writers sometimes credited him as being the first pharaoh of a united egypt we know today that this is not true — there was a group of egyptian rulers that predated menes scholars sometimes refer to these premenes rulers as being part of a dynasty zero \\n\\ndynasties 36 date from roughly 2650–2150 bc and are often lumped into a time period called the old kingdom by modernday scholars during this time pyramid building techniques were developed and the pyramids of giza were built \\n\\nfrom 2150–2030 bc a time period that encompassed dynasties 710 and part of the 11 the central government in egypt was weak and the country was often controlled by different regional leaders why the old kingdom collapsed is a matter of debate among scholars with recent research indicating that drought and climate change played a significant role during this time other cities and civilizations in the middle east also collapsed with evidence at archaeological sites indicating that a period of drought and arid climate hit sites across the middle east \\n\\ndynasties 12 13 as well as part of the 11th are often called the middle kingdom by scholars and lasted from ca 2030–1640 bc at the start of this dynasty a ruler named mentuhotep ii who reigned until about 2000 bc reunited egypt into a single country pyramid building resumed in egypt and a sizable number of texts documenting the civilization’s literature and science were recorded among the surviving texts is the edwin smith surgical papyrus which includes a variety of medical treatments that modernday medical doctors have hailed as being advanced for their time \\n\\ndynasties 1417 are often lumped into the second intermediate period by modernday scholars during this time central government again collapsed in egypt with part of the country being occupied by the hyksos a group from the levant an area that encompasses modernday israel palestine lebanon jordan and syria one gruesome find from this time period is a series of severed hands cut off from their human victims which were found at a palace at the city of avaris the capital of hyksoscontrolled egypt the cutoff hands may have been presented by soldiers to a ruler in exchange for gold \\n\\nscholars often refer to dynasties 1820 as encompassing the new kingdom a period that lasted ca 1550–1070 bc this time period takes place after the hyksos had been driven out of egypt by a series of egyptian rulers and the country was reunited perhaps the most famous archaeological site from this time period is the valley of the kings which holds the burial sites of many egyptian rulers from this time period including that of tutankhamun reign ca 1336–1327 bc whose rich tomb was found intact photos more than 40 tombs discovered in upper egypt \\n\\ndynasties 2124 a period from ca 1070–713 bc are often called the third intermediate period by modernday scholars the central government was sometimes weak during this time period and the country was not always united during this time cities and civilizations across the middle east had been destroyed by a wave of people from the aegean whom modernday scholars sometimes call the sea peoples while egyptian rulers claimed to have defeated the sea peoples in battle it didn’t prevent egyptian civilization from also collapsing the loss of trade routes and revenue may have played a role in the weakening of egypt’s central government \\n\\ndynasties 2531 date ca 712–332 bc are often referred to as the late period by scholars egypt was sometimes under the control of foreign powers during this period the rulers of the 25th dynasty were from nubia an area now located in southern egypt and northern sudan the persians and assyrians also controlled egypt at different times during the late period \\n\\nin 332 bc alexander the great drove the persians out of egypt and incorporated the country into the macedonian empire after alexander the great’s death a line of rulers descended from ptolemy soter one of alexander’s generals the last of these ptolemaic rulers as scholars often call them was cleopatra vii who committed suicide in 30 bc after the defeat of her forces by the roman emperor augustus at the battle of actium after her death egypt was incorporated into the roman empire \\n\\nalthough the roman emperors were based in rome the egyptians treated them as pharaohs one recently excavated carving shows the emperor claudius reign ad 4154 dressed as a pharaoh the carving has hieroglyphic inscriptions that say that claudius is the son of ra lord of the crowns and is king of upper and lower egypt lord of the two lands\\n\\nneither the ptolemaic or roman rulers are considered to be part of a numbered dynasty \\nreligion\\nthroughout much of egypt’s ancient history its people followed a polytheistic religion in which a vast number of gods and goddesses were venerated one of the most important was osiris god of the underworld abydos was an important cult center for him and numerous temples and shrines were constructed at the site in his honor \\n\\nnavigating the underworld was vital to the ancient egyptians who believed that the dead could reach a paradise of sorts where they could live forever egyptian dead were sometimes mummified preserving the body and were sometimes buried with spells that aided them in navigating the underworld \\n\\nin ancient egyptian mythology one of the first steps in navigating the underworld was to weigh a persons deeds against the feather of maat if the person had committed a great deal of wrongdoing the persons heart would be heavier than the feather and the persons soul would be obliterated on the other hand if their deeds were generally good they passed forward and had the opportunity to successfully navigate the underworld  \\n\\nfigurines called shabti were often buried with the deceased — their purpose being to do the work of the deceased in the afterlife for them \\n\\negyptian religion did not remain static but changed over time one major change occurred during the reign of the pharaoh akhenaten ca 13531335 bc a ruler who unleashed a religious revolution that saw egyptian religion become focused around the worship of the aten the sun disk he built an entirely new capital in the desert at amarna and ordered the names of some of egypts deities to be defaced after akhenaten’s death his son tutankhamun denounced him and returned egypt to its previous polytheistic religion \\n\\nwhen egypt came under greek and roman rule their gods and goddesses were incorporated into egyptian religion another major change occurred after the first century ad when christianity spread throughout egypt at this time gnosticism a religion that incorporated some christian beliefs also spread throughout egypt and a large corpus of gnostic texts were discovered in 1945 in southern egypt near the city of nag hammadi \\n\\nislam spread throughout the country after ad 641 after the country was captured by a muslim army today islam is practiced by the majority of egypts inhabitants while a minority are christian many being part of the coptic church amun\\n\\namun was one of the eight ancient egyptian gods who formed the ogdoad of hermopolis he was the god of the air and his consort was ament amaunet however during the twelfth dynasty middle kingdom amun was adopted in thebes as the king of the gods with mut as his consort amun and mut had one child the moon god khonsu he was promoted to national god by ahmose i the first pharaoh of the new kingdom because the king believed that amun had helped him drive the hyksos from egypt he was also adopted into the ennead of heliopolis when he merged with the ancient sun god ra to become amunra\\n\\nit is possible that there were once two separate gods with the same name but equally likely that amun of heliopolis merely took on the attributes of the theban god montu montju when he replaced him as the principle god of the nome in the later period\\n\\nhis name is generally translated as “the hidden one” or “the secret one” and it was thought that he created himself and then created everything else while remaining distanced and separate from the world in that sense he was the original inscrutable and indivisible creator when he merged with ra he became both a visible and invisible deity this duality the hidden god and the visible sun appealed to the egyptian concept of balance and duality leading to an association between amunra and maat\\n\\namun was also identified with montu who he pretty much absorbed and the hybrid gods amun–ra–atum amunramontu amunrehorakhty and amunmin\\n\\namun was associated with a number of animals whose form he sometimes took in inscriptions originally he was depicted as a goose and given the epithet the “great cackler” like geb it was also thought that he could regenerate himself by becoming a snake and shedding his skin\\n\\nhowever he was most frequently depicted as a ram a symbol of fertility he is also depicted as a man with the head of a ram a frog an uraeus royal cobra a crocodile or as an ape finally he is depicted as a king sitting on his throne wearing the double plumed crown also associated with min during the ptolemaic period images of amun were cast in bronze in which he was depicted as bearded man with four arms the body of a beetle the wings of a hawk the legs of a man and the paws and claws of a lion\\n\\namun is described as the primeval creator in the pyramid texts which depict him as a primeval deity and a symbol of creative force however he rose to prominence during the eleventh dynasty when he replaced the theban war god montu as the principle deity of the city from that point the fortunes of the god were closely linked to the prominence of thebes itself when the theban ahmose i successfully expelled the hyksos from egypt he was quick to show his gratitude to amun and throughout the middle kingdom the royal family established temples to amun most notably the luxor temple and the great temple at karnak during the new kingdom he gained such power that one could almost view egypt as a monotheistic state\\n\\namunra was considered to be the father and protector of the pharaoh and the priests of amun controlled an impressive proportion of egyptian land and resources the theban royal women also wielded great power and influence and were closely involved with the cult of amun queen ahmose nefertari the great wife of the pharaoh ahmose i was granted the title “god’s wife of amun” with reference to the myth that amun created the world by masturbation this title was then granted to the great wife of every pharaoh in recognition of her role in the state religion of amun the female pharaoh hatshepsut went one stage further and specifically stated that amun had impregnated her mother in the guise of the pharaoh thuthmoses ii her father thus she established her right to rule on the basis that she was his daughter\\n\\nhowever the god could also reveal his will through the oracles who were in the control of the priests and they had been granted so much land that they even rivalled the power of the pharaoh amenhotep iii instituted some reforms when he became concerned that the theban clergy had become too powerful but his son akhenaten went one further and actually replaced amun with the aten and constructed a new capital city named akhetaten however the experiment was shortlived and both amen and thebes were reinstated under the rule of tutankhamun\\n\\nthe worship of amun even spread into neighbouring countries particularly nubia by the twentyfifth dynastyamenra was the principle god of the kingdom of napata nubia who believed he came from gebel barkal in northern sudan and the greeks considered him to be the equivalent of zeus\\n\\nhis main celebration was the opet festival in which the statue of amun traveled down the nile from the temple of karnak to the temple of luxor to celebrate amun’s marriage to mut or taweret in this festival he had a procreative function epitomised in his title “kamutef” “bull of his mother”why hitler secretly met with a japanese general during wwii\\ntomoyuki yamashita and the führer had their own separate agendas later they

great pyramid of khufu towers above the desert at 481 feet it was the tallest building on the planet for over 3800 years until the construction of england’s lincoln cathedral in 1300\\n\\nthe three giza pyramids are located on the outskirts of cairo they were built between 2550 and 2490 bc to serve as a mortuary temple for pharaohs khufu khefre and menkaure exactly how the pyramids were built and by whom remains a mystery today\\n\\nfor years it was believed to be the work of slaves but it is now thought that the builders were probably skilled workers from all over the country the

structures were built 4500 years ago is truly mindblowing yet just a few miles away there are some pyramids that are even older\\n\\nthe pyramids in saqqara and dhashur were built around 200 years before those at giza saqqara and dhashur were the necropolises of memphis the capital of egypt during the old kingdom they’re now a true treasure trove for archaeologists and anyone interested in

sites in luxor is karnak temple a vast complex of temples and palaces it was built in dedication to three egyptian gods– amun mut and khonsu– and gradually enlarged over a period of two thousand years\\n\\nkarnak temple is the largest religious building ever constructed covering a surface of 200 acres the largest section is the hypostyle hall which encompasses 54000 square feet and features 134 columns making it the biggest room of any religious building in the world \\n\\nluxor temple\\nlocated about 15 miles from karnak you’ll find the worldrenowned luxor temple this is another spectacular complex of temples and shrines built by several pharaohs and dedicated to the “theban triad” of gods mentioned above\\n\\nkarnak and luxor temples were once joined by an avenue lined with sphinxes which has been partially unearthed walking down this avenue in the early morning mist or after sunset when it’s all lit up will make you feel as if you’re stepping in the footsteps of ancient history\\n\\nanother notable feature of luxor temple is that it’s been used almost continuously for worship a coptic church was built on the site after christianity spread to egypt and in subsequent centuries a mosque was erected which is still in use today\\n\\nvalley of the kings\\nthe karnak and luxor temples lie on the east bank of the nile– the city of the living where the city of thebes once stood the west bank was always the city of the dead where cemeteries mortuary temples and mausoleums were and still are located\\n\\nanother spectacular ancient site in luxor is the valley of the kings where pharaohs were buried for over 500 years the tombs consist of a series of underground chambers which are beautifully decorated with wall paintings and hieroglyphs ending with the room where the pharaohs’ mummies were placed in a sarcophagus\\n\\nmost of the sarcophagi and mummies now lie in cairo’s egyptian museum with the exception of king tutankhamun\\n\\ntemple of hatshepsut\\nthis temple is located just a short drive away from the valley of the kings it was built to honor of hatshepsut one of the few female pharaohs in egyptian history\\n\\nthe temple is noteworthy because of its architecture it has three levels with colonnaded terraces and it’s built in a style reminiscent of the greek and roman classical architecture that emerged a thousand years later\\n\\nthe various levels feature decorated columns carvings and hieroglyphs\\n\\ntemple of hathor\\nfrom luxor we’ll embark on a fourday nile cruise to aswan taking in some of the best ancient egyptian historical sites located along the great river\\n\\nthe first stop will be the temple of hathor at denderah one of the bestpreserved temple complexes in all of egypt it features a maze of underground passages plus walls decorated with carvings and reliefs that still retain surprisingly vivid colors\\n\\none of the bestknown basreliefs is the denderah zodiac which is located on the roof of a chapel and depicts images of taurus and libra the relief in the temple is actually a replica the original now resides in the louvre in paris\\n\\ntemple of horus\\nanother stunning temple located in the vicinity of the nile is the temple of horus in edfu\\n\\nthis is very wellpreserved site because it’s far more recent than the luxor and karnak temples it was completed in the ptolemaic period between 237 and 57 bc another reason why this temple is in such good condition is that it was buried in sand for hundreds of years which contributed to preserving the carvings and wall paintings inside\\n\\nthe temple is dedicated to horus the falcon god who is frequently portrayed in statues and wall decorations around the site it is also one of the few temples to survive with an intact ceiling\\n\\ntemple of kom ombo\\nnot far from the temple of horus there’s also the kom ombo temple one of the most unusual egyptian historical sites\\n\\nkom ombo is known as a “double temple” as it was dedicated to two different sets of gods the southern part of the temple is dedicated to the crocodile god sobek the god of fertility and creator of the world and the northern side is in honor of horus\\n\\nthe two parts of the temple are exactly symmetrical which is a true rarity in ancient egyptian architecture\\n\\nabu simbel\\nafter reaching aswan we’ll fly to abu simbel a temple complex in the far south of egypt there twin temples were carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century bc and dedicated to the great pharaoh ramesses ii and his wife\\n\\nthe most recognizable feature of both temples are the colossal statues you’ll find at the entrance the ramesses ii ones reach up to 65 feet\\n\\nabu simbel is unique because the two temples were about to disappear under the water of the aswan high

developed by the maya peoples and noted for its logosyllabic script—the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system in precolumbian americas—as well as for its art architecture mathematics calendar and astronomical system the maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern mexico all of guatemala and belize and the western portions of honduras and el salvador this region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the yucatán peninsula and the highlands of the sierra madre running from the mexican state of chiapas across southern guatemala and onwards into el salvador and the southern lowlands of the pacific littoral plain the overarching term maya is a modern collective term that refers to the peoples of the region however the term was not used by the indigenous populations themselves since there never was a common sense of identity or political unity among the distinct populations1\\n\\nthe archaic period prior to 2000 bc saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages the preclassic period c\\u20092000 bc to 250 ad saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the maya region and the cultivation of the staple crops of the maya diet including maize beans squashes and chili peppers the first maya cities developed around 750 bc and by 500 bc these cities possessed monumental architecture including large temples with elaborate stucco façades hieroglyphic writing was being used in the maya region by the 3rd century bc in the late preclassic a number of large cities developed in the petén basin and the city of kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the guatemalan highlands beginning around 250 ad the classic period is largely defined as when the maya were raising sculpted monuments with long count dates this period saw the maya civilization develop many citystates linked by a complex trade network in the maya lowlands two great rivals the cities of tikal and calakmul became powerful the classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central mexican city of teotihuacan in maya dynastic politics in the 9th century there was a widespread political collapse in the central maya region resulting in internecine warfare the abandonment of cities and a northward shift of population the postclassic period saw the rise of chichen itza in the north and the expansion of the aggressive kʼicheʼ kingdom in the guatemalan highlands in the 16th century the spanish empire colonised the mesoamerican region and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of nojpetén the last maya city in 1697\\n\\nclassic period rule was centred on the concept of the divine king who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm kingship was patrilineal and power would normally pass to the eldest son a prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage although the exact political makeup of a kingdom varied from citystate to citystate by the late classic the aristocracy had greatly increased resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king the maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms and the maya created art using both perishable and nonperishable materials including wood jade obsidian ceramics sculpted stone monuments stucco and finely painted murals\\n\\nmaya cities tended to expand haphazardly and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways the principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces pyramidtemples ceremonial ballcourts and structures aligned for astronomical observation the maya elite were literate and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the precolumbian americas the maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books of which only three uncontested examples remain the rest having been destroyed by the spanish there are also a great many examples of maya text found on stelae and ceramics the maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the explicit zero in the world as a part of their religion the maya practised human sacrifice\\n\\nmesoamerica\\n\\nthe maya civilization developed within the mesoamerican cultural area which covers a region that spreads from northern mexico southwards into central america2 mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide3 the mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies agriculture cities monumental architecture writing and calendrical systems4 the set of traits shared by mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge blood and human sacrifice and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions each with different attributes and a threeway division of the world into the celestial realm the earth and the underworld5\\n\\nby 6000 bc the early inhabitants of mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants a process that eventually led to the establishment of sedentary agricultural societies6 the diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops but all regions of mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize beans and squashes7 all mesoamerican cultures used stone age technology after c 1000 ad copper silver and gold were worked mesoamerica lacked draft animals did not use the wheel and possessed few domesticated animals the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe8 mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities the ritual mesoamerican ballgame was widely played9 mesoamerica is linguistically diverse with most languages falling within a small number of language families—the major families are mayan mixe–zoquean otomanguean and utoaztecan there are also a number of smaller families and isolates the mesoamerican language area shares a number of important features including widespread loanwords and use of a vigesimal number system10\\n\\nthe territory of the maya covered a third of mesoamerica11 and the maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the olmecs mixtecs teotihuacan the aztecs and others12 during the early classic period the maya cities of tikal and kaminaljuyu were key maya foci in a network that extended beyond the maya area into the highlands of central mexico13 at around the same time there was a strong maya presence at the tetitla compound of teotihuacan14 centuries later during the 9th century ad murals at cacaxtla another site in the central mexican highlands were painted in a maya style15 this may have been either an effort to align itself with the stillpowerful maya area after the collapse of teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the mexican highlands16 or an attempt to express a distant maya origin of the inhabitants17 the maya city of chichen itza and the distant toltec capital of tula had an especially close relationship18\\n\\nhistory\\n\\nthe history of maya civilization is divided into three principal periods the preclassic classic and postclassic periods28 these were preceded by the archaic period during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged29 modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of maya chronology rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline30 definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century depending on the author31prehistory\\nhuman prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c 33 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems the earliest writing systems appeared c 5300 years ago but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present the end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently\\n\\nsumer in mesopotamia the indus valley civilization and ancient egypt were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records this took place already during the early bronze age neighboring civilizations were the first to follow most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the iron age the threeage system of division of prehistory into the stone age followed by the bronze age and iron age remains in use for much of eurasia and north africa but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with eurasian cultures such as the americas oceania australasia and much of subsaharan africa these areas also with some exceptions in precolumbian civilizations in the americas did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of eurasians and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of australia\\n\\nthe period when a culture is written about by others but has not developed its own writing is often known as the protohistory of the culture by definition1 there are no written records from human prehistory so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial clear techniques for dating were not welldeveloped until the 19th century2\\n\\nthis article is concerned with human prehistory the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history earlier periods are also called prehistoric there are separate articles for the overall history of the earth and the history of life before humans\\ndefinition\\nbeginning\\nthe term prehistory can refer to the vast span of time since the beginning of the universe or the earth but more often it refers to the period since life appeared on earth or even more specifically to the time since humanlike beings appeared34\\nend\\nthe date marking the end of prehistory is typically defined as the advent of the contemporary written historical record56 the date consequently varies widely from region to region depending on the date when relevant records become a useful academic resource7 for example in egypt it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 bce whereas in new guinea the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently at around 1900 common era in europe the relatively welldocumented classical cultures of ancient greece and ancient rome had neighbouring cultures including the celts and to a lesser extent the etruscans with little or no writing and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these prehistoric cultures in greek and roman literature\\ntime periods\\nin dividing up human prehistory in eurasia historians typically use the threeage system whereas scholars of prehuman time periods typically use the welldefined geologic record and its internationally defined stratum base within the geologic time scale the threeage system is the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods named for their respective predominant toolmaking technologies\\nstone age\\nbronze age\\niron age8\\nhistory of the term\\nthe notion of prehistory began to surface during the enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word primitive to describe societies that existed before written records9 the first use of the word prehistory in english however occurred in the foreign quarterly review in 183610\\n\\nthe use of the geologic time scale for prehuman time periods and of the threeage system for human prehistory is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of british german and scandinavian archeologists

drops bernard wilkin explores the significant role of aerial warfare in world war one – where it was used on a large scale for the first time\\naerial warfare was by no means a first world war invention balloons had already been used for observation and propaganda distribution during the napoleonic wars and the francoprussian conflict of 18701871 planes had been used for bombardment missions during the italoturkish war of 19111912 yet aerial warfare during the first world war marked a rupture with these past examples it was the first conflict during which aircraft were involved on a large scale and played a significant role\\n\\nobservation fighters and bombardment\\nat the beginning of the war the usefulness of air machines was met with a certain amount of scepticism by senior officers on all sides in fact aeroplanes were mostly involved in observation missions during the first year of the conflict however rapid progress enhanced aeroplanes’ performance in 1915 the dutch aircraft manufacturer anthony fokker who was working for the germans perfected a french invention allowing machinegun fire through the propeller this discovery had a revolutionary consequence the creation of fighter aircraft this type of plane gave an edge to the germans during 1915 their air superiority was to last until april 1916 two months after the beginning of the battle of verdun thereafter allied dominance was gained through the creation of french fighting squadrons and the expansion of the british royal flying corps the control of the sky was to change hands again in the first half of 1917 when the germans reformed their squadrons and introduced modern fighters during april 1917 nicknamed ‘bloody april’ the british suffered four times more casualties than the germans but things were on the move on the allied side successful reorganisations in france and britain brought back air control for good until the armistice\\nduring 1915 another important step was taken when the germans organised strategic bombing over britain and france by zeppelin airships in 191718 ‘gotha’ and ‘giant’ bombers were also used this new type of mission targeting logistic and manufacturing centres prefigured a strategy commonly adopted later in the century inevitably bombardments of ports and factories were quickly adopted by all sides and led to civilian deaths although the number of civilians killed by aerial machines remained small during the war these air raids nonetheless caused widespread terror yet planes were on occasions a welcome sight indeed aircraft and balloons were used by the allies from 1915 to 1918 to drop propaganda leaflets over occupied france belgium and italy in order to combat german psychological warfare propaganda was also dropped on german soldiers in an attempt to demoralise them\\naviators in the spotlight\\nin 1915 aviation caught the attention of the press both in germany and in the allied countries fighting pilots credited with at least five victories became known as ‘aces’ and were admired as celebrities on home fronts until the end of the conflict this phenomenon illustrates the ability of war culture to penetrate all aspects of society but also underlines a paradox heroes of the air became glamorous because they were clean and deemed noble while their infantry counterparts remained an anonymous mass stuck in the mud of the trenches this romanticized admiration by the public of flying aces was a cause of tension and jealousy between army and air force\\n\\naviation and the war effort\\nwas aviation in the first world war invaluable to the war effort the question has been controversial since the armistice collective memory has retained an admiration for the contribution made in the air on the western front but it should be remembered that aviation also played a role in other theatres of operation indeed planes were used on a smaller scale on the eastern front in the balkans and even briefly in the german colony of tsingtao in china most of the nations involved in the war including countries such as austriahungary belgium bulgaria italy russia and the united states developed their own air forces it is certain that aerial photography was hugely helpful for artillery the most devastating weapon of the war tactical air support had a big impact on troop morale and proved helpful both to the allies and the germans during 1918 when coordinated with ground force actions but such operations were too dependent on the weather to have a considerable effect meanwhile fighting planes had a significant impact in facilitating other aerial activities aviation made huge technological leaps forward during the conflict the war in the air also proved to be a field of experimentation where tactics and doctrines were imagined and tested air force units were reorganised on numerous occasions to meet the growing need of this new weapon crucially aerial strategies developed during the first world war laid the foundations for a modern form of warfare in the skyamerica in the first world war\\njennifer keene explores the events that led up to the united states of america joining the first world war and describes the effect that participation in the war had on american social and political life\\n‘the world must be made safe for democracy’ proclaimed president woodrow wilson as he stood before congress asking for a declaration of war against germany after remaining neutral for nearly three years why did the united states finally decide to enter the war in april 1917 what did the war mean to americans on the home front and those who fought overseas wilson’s idealistic pronouncements propelled the united states into a position of world leadership but the war’s impact on american democracy was murkier\\nthe american path to war\\nwhen the first world war began in 1914 the united states resolved to sit on the sidelines neutrality however proved easier to proclaim than maintain the expectation of a short war the american people’s diverse ancestral ties to both allied and central powers and the lack of any clear danger to us territory made wilson’s decision to remain neutral both practical and popular in 1915 however the political calculus changed when britain and germany both began targeting enemy supply lines on the high seas the naval war directly affected the united states the british blockade of the north sea annoyed americans but rapidly increasing trade with britain made up for losing access to german markets the german policy of unrestricted submarine warfare however quickly became intolerable especially when american lives were lost on 7 may 1915 a german uboat torpedoed the lusitania a british passenger ship off the coast of ireland killing 1198 civilians 128 americans among them germany defended the sinking pointing out that americans had been warned to stay off ships heading into the war zone wilson nonetheless demanded that germany amend its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare by curtailing attacks on passenger and merchant ships after two more controversial sinkings germany temporarily agreed\\nin 1916 domestic debates over the war became more heated the ‘preparedness movement’ argued that the nation was vulnerable to attack and thus needed to strengthen its military but pacifist groups such as the american union against militarism saw any increase in defence spending as a step towards war midwesterners and southerners criticised wall street for loaning money to britain and pressed for an arms embargo meanwhile people throughout the nation contributed food clothes and money to help ease civilian suffering in belgium france italy and russia few people however donated to help german civilians suffering from the effects of the blockade\\nfinally on 2 april 1917 wilson went before congress to ask for a declaration of war wilson cited germany’s decision to resume unrestricted submarine warfare its spying and sabotage operations within the united states and the zimmermann telegram an attempt to lure mexico into fighting the united states alongside germany as evidence of germany’s hostile intent against the united states the president also declared that america was fighting for ‘the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the german peoples included’ after a testy congressional debate the united states declared war against germany on 7 april 1917 it did not declare war against austriahungary until 7 december the united states entered the allied coalition as an associated power with no obligation to accept preexisting allied agreements on postwar territorial settlements wilson was determined to press for a peace settlement based on the principles listed in his war address and later on the fourteen points\\nwoodrow wilson’s fourteen points\\nwilson issued his fourteen points at a perilous moment when revolutiontorn russia was negotiating a separate peace agreement with germany in his address to congress on 8 january 1918 wilson tried unsuccessfully to convince russia to reject the punitive peace offered by germany repeating the call for a peace without victory wilson assured germany ‘a place of equality among the peoples of the world’ after it evacuated all occupied territories in europe\\n\\nthe majority of the fourteen points focused on settling the problems that wilson believed caused the war nationalism imperialism the arms race and territorial disagreements the final point proposed the creation of a league of nations to guarantee ‘political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike’ this ambitious plan was also designed to please americans wilson’s emphasis on maintaining freedom of the seas addressed the issue that had driven the united states to take up arms against germany his desire to reduce arms ‘to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety’ reflected america’s traditional preference for a small peacetime army finally wilson suggested redrawing boundaries in southern and eastern europe to place populations with similar ethnic identities in the same nationstates an idea that appealed to recent immigrants from these regions\\n\\nthe fourteen points raised hopes that a better world might emerge from the terrible slaughter germany even requested an armistice based on the fourteen points in october 1918 eager to avoid a harsh peace settlement wilson headed to the peace conference as the man of the hour but french premier georges clemenceau was more sceptical ‘god gave us the ten commandments and we broke them wilson gives us the fourteen points we shall see’ he quipped foreshadowing the opposition that wilson would encounter as the victors negotiated the terms of peace\\n\\npublic perception of the war\\nofficial propaganda and expansive wartime sedition legislation shaped how americans talked and thought about the war speaking out against the war meant risking arrest and possible jail time with the result that only the most committed pacifists continued to criticise the war even remaining silent was not enough the government urged everyone to actively contribute to the war effort propaganda posters whipped up patriotic fervour encouraging americans to enlist in the armed forces conserve food buy liberty bonds sing patriotic songs knit socks and keep on the lookout for german spies the committee on public information orchestrated the government’s wartime propaganda campaign which permeated the workplace cinema music halls and even classrooms\\nwilson led the nation into war with high ideals but once american soldiers began dying sentiment hardened against anything german states outlawed teaching german symphonies stopped playing works by german composers and among the large population of german americans citizens changed their last names in droves to demonstrate their loyalty vigilantes attacked people identified as ‘progerman’ often forcing the accused to kiss an american flag sing the national anthem or endure physical torture\\n\\nthe fight for democracy ‘at home’\\nfemale suffragists and african american civil rights activists drew inspiration from wilson’s promise to spread democracy radical female suffragists pioneered a new protest tactic when they decided to picket the white house to draw attention to their demand for the vote moderate suffragists chose a strategy of loyalty volunteering extensively for wartime committees to demonstrate that the nation depended on its female citizenry to defend the nation the mounting pressure eventually convinced wilson to become the first president to publicly support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing female suffrage a major step towards the eventual ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 which officially granted the vote to women however citizenship and state laws meant that black women native american women asian women women unable to pay poll taxes and more besides were prohibited from exercising their right to vote\\n\\nmuch to their dismay african americans discovered that it made little difference whether they served the nation loyally or protested loudly and that the nation’s commitment to white supremacy hardened over the course of the war however the war was a transformative moment for the african american community communitybased mobilization during the war whether to rally the black community to buy war bonds or to protest discriminatory treatment of african american soldiers benefitted the civil rights movement new leaders emerged membership in fledgling groups like the naacp national association for the advancement of colored people grew and the war’s democratic rhetoric infused the movement with a new ideological focus returning black soldiers angry about the racial discrimination they encountered within the segregated wartime army helped form an ethos of ‘fighting back’ both literally and figuratively which laid the foundation for a more militant postwar civil rights movement\\nthe experiences of troops\\nthrough conscription the us army grew from a constabulary force of 300000 peacetime troops to a 42 millionstrong american expeditionary force aef over the course of 18 months the army reflected the ethnic and racial diversity of the american population and included nonenglish speaking immigrants native americans african americans hispanic americans and secondgeneration german americans the propaganda slogan ‘americans all’ promoted wartime service as a unifying americanising experience that rendered differences in language culture and religion irrelevant race still mattered however the entrenched racism of white americans shaped the experiences of all troops and racial discrimination remained widespread the us wartime army was rigidly segregated and black troops who were largely under the command of white officers were subjected to poor living and working conditions\\n\\ngermany had taken a gamble by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare hoping to defeat the allies before the united states could make a difference in the war germany launched a series of spring offensives along the western front trying to secure a definitive breakthrough but ultimately lost this race against time in the late spring the americans fought their first battles at cantigny belleau wood and châteauthierry on the outskirts of paris then helped the allies drive the german army back throughout the summer\\n\\nin the fall general john j pershing took command of an americancontrolled sector along the western front an important development that made the american military contribution highly visible pershing had successfully fended off british and french efforts to permanently amalgamate the american forces into preexisting allied armies wilson wanted american troops to play a crucial independent part in the ultimate victory thereby earning him a prominent role in shaping the peace the aef fought its last and largest battle in the meuseargonne from 26 september to 1 november 1918 its contribution to the final allied offensive that ended the war this 47day operation involved 12 million american troops and is the second most lethal battle in american history\\n\\noverall the american army engaged in six months of active fighting at the cost of 53000 lives in addition nearly 63000 men died of disease primarily from influenza and 200000 veterans returned home wounded although we have recently seen a small revival of public interest in these men they and the battles they fought have been largely forgotten by most americansanimals and war\\nmillions of animals were relied upon by all sides in world war one curator dr matthew shaw discusses the role of animals in transport logistics cavalry and communications and considers their psychological function for troops and as propaganda\\nintroduction\\nwhile the first world war witnessed the development of modern technological warfare it also made unprecedented demands on what we might see as archaic methods of campaigning despite the tanks planes and machine guns fighting still depended on the physical and emotional suffering and sacrifice of men who also had to contend with mud sand water disease and often brutal weather moreover like fighting men since time immemorial the armies of the allies and the central powers depended on the efforts and skills of animals for transport logistics communications and at times solace\\nbeasts of burden\\nthe extent of the logistical apparatus that made the war feasible is almost impossible to imagine today hundreds of tons of armaments remain to be discovered under the former battlefields of belgium and france the numbers and weights involved are vast during the battle of verdun for example some 32 million shells were fired while the british barrage preceding the battle of the somme fired some 15 million shells in total nearly 250 million shells were used by the british army and navy during the war railways trucks and ships transported these munitions for much of their journey but they also relied on hundreds of thousands of horses donkeys oxen and even camels or dogs for their transport field guns were pulled into position by teams of six to 12 horses and the dead and wounded carted away in horsedrawn ambulances the millions of men at the front and behind the lines also had to be fed and supplied with equipment much of which was again hauled by fourlegged beasts of burden because of the deep mud and craters at the front much of this could only be carried by mules or horses even the british army which could boast that it was the most mechanised of the belligerent forces relied largely on horse power for its transport much of it organised by the army service corps by november 1918 the british army had almost 500000 horses which helped to distribute 34000 tons of meat and 45000 tons of bread each month the animals themselves needed feeding and watering and british horses had to carry some 16000 tons of forage each month in total perhaps six million horses were engaged by all sides looking after these animals were specially trained soldiers who knew how to care for such beasts from their jobs before the war and who were also trained in modern methods of animal husbandry although the level of training varied from army to army\\nsupply of horses and other animals\\nwithout the millions of horses mules and donkeys serving on the various fronts the war of attrition would have been impossible losses through exhaustion disease such as infection from the tsetse fly in east africa starvation and enemy action were high 120000 horses were treated in british veterinary hospitals in one year many of which were field hospitals the resupply of horses and other animals was a major concern for the leadership of all sides at the outbreak of the war britain’s horse population stood at under 25000 and so it turned to the united states which supplied around a million horses during the war canada and argentina germany had prepared for war with an extensive breeding and registration programme and at the start of the war had a ratio of one horse to every three men however while the allies could import horses from america the central powers could only replace their losses by conquest and requisitioned many thousands from belgium from invaded french territory and from the ukraine the difficulty of replacing horses arguably contributed to the eventual defeat of the central powers\\ncavalry and fighting animals\\ndespite the machine gun barbed wire and trenches or thick bushes in the levant cavalry proved to be remarkably effective during the conflict where mobile fighting could take place cavalry saw considerable action at mons and russian cavalry penetrated deep into germany during the early phases of the war cavalry were still occasionally used in their traditional role as shock troops even later in the war cavalry were effective in palestine although were obstructed by thick bushes as much as by barbed wire cavalrymen from britain and her colonies were trained to fight both on foot and mounted which perhaps accounts for horses’ more frequent use by these armies than by other european forces during the conflict but most military tacticians had already recognised that the importance of mounted soldiers had waned in the age of mechanised war a shift that had already become apparent in the american civil war where cavalry regiments were maintained on the western front many considered them a drain on men and resources and futile in the face of machine guns this was despite the esteem in which such regiments were still held in the traditional military mind and the public popularity of the image of the dashing cavalryman\\ncommunications\\nas well as acting as beasts of burden or participants in the fighting animals also played a vital role in communication trained dogs were used to carry messages from the front lines especially by the german forces and both sides made particularly heavy use of pigeons trained birds which could fly at 40kph or faster relayed messages back from the front lines to headquarters often more reliably or securely than telecommunications or radio naval ships submarines and military aeroplanes routinely carried several pigeons to deploy in case of sinking or a crash landing mobile homing pigeon units acted as communication hubs and in britain pigeon fanciers assisted in breeding and training for the war effort the french deployed some 72 pigeon lofts pigeons also captured the popular imagination with one american bird ‘cher ami’ awarded a french medal for her service within the american sector near the town of verdun on her last mission she successfully carried her message despite being shot through the chest and purportedly saved the lives of 194 american soldiers with her newschinas great war\\nprofessor xu guoqi provides an overview of china’s involvement in the first world war including the role of the chinese labour corps clc on the western front and the impact of the peace conference on china’s future\\neven today many people know little if anything about china’s deep involvement in the first world war perhaps it is surprising to learn that there was even a battlefield in china where the british fought against german troops the chinese port city of qingdao tsingtao had been under german control since 1898 when the war broke out in europe in 1914 britain and its ally japan were determined to kick germany out of east asia after intensive fighting german troops in qingdao were forced to surrender in november 1914 and the allies took possession of the colony\\nwhy did china become involved in the first world war\\nthe qingdao battle might have been beyond china’s control yet china’s citizens and government were not only interested in the first world war but also took major initiatives to participate in it to understand china’s great war we first have to pay attention to events that unfolded from 1895 onwards after china was defeated by japan in the first sinojapanese war 1894–95 the chinese were deeply worried about their nation’s future fearing that it could disintegrate in response they pursued and adopted desperate measures in the early 20th century china abolished confucian ideology which had served as the official religiouspolitical doctrine for over 2000 years and destroyed the dynastical system which had ruled the country since 221 bce both systems were held responsible as sources of china’s weakness in their determination to strengthen china the country was declared a republic in 1912 we have to keep in mind that republicanism was still a radical political system and few nations were truly republics at that time\\n\\nby adopting these dramatic measures the chinese hoped to turn china into an equal member in the ‘family of nations’ since the opium wars of the 1840s china had existed as a semicolonial nation under the control of western powers and later japan the outbreak of the first world war presented china with a great opportunity to confront the existing world order which had been hostile to china for many decades and recover its long lost sovereignty including control of qingdao and shandong province china announced its neutrality but motivated by these possibilities made a secret attempt to declare war on germany as soon as the war started however countries including britain and japan who both had economic and diplomatic interests in china blocked china’s official entry into the war the chinese felt even more threatened when japan presented to their government the ‘twentyone demands’ which extended direct japanese control and in effect revealed japan’s intention to colonise chinese provinces\\n\\n1915 onwards the role of chinese labourers and the chinese labour corps\\ndetermined to create a place for china within the postwar world order in 1915 the government adopted a creative strategy which they called ‘yigong daibing’ or to use workers as soldiers at the same time as the chinese reeled under japan’s twentyone demands the war in europe dragged on casualties increased and the french and then british faced a ‘manpower’ crisis china’s offer of an unlimited supply of labour was an astonishing opportunity for both countries to support their war efforts the french and british started to bring chinese workers to france as early as 1916 to dig trenches repair tanks and transport supplies among other tasks in total roughly 140000 chinese workers arrived on the western front many travelling via canada those recruited by the british were collectively known as the chinese labour corps clc among all the countries involved china sent the largest number of men and its workers remained in france the longest many under british supervision would stay until 1920 while most men under the french stayed until 1922 working to clear live ammunition exhume bodies from battlefields and carve gravestones for war cemeteries although their contribution has since been largely forgotten these chinese labourers were critical to the british and french war efforts and about 3000 men lost their lives the chinese were regarded as especially skillful at trench digging and thus played a crucial role by maintaining battlefield infrastructures in a war dominated by trench warfare\\nthe journey of 140000 chinese citizens to europe is an extremely important chapter in both chinese and world history while western civilization was facing a major crisis as a result of the war china was at its own critical moment striving to abolish its traditional confucian civilization and embrace a new one that was international in its outlook these chinese workers to a great extent were messengers between the east and west and at the same time served as harbingers of china’s search for a new national identity\\n1917–19 from declaring war to the postwar peace conference\\nin august 1917 china was finally successful in declaring war on germany and the austriahungary empire although the allies now allowed china to join the war they did not support the beijing government’s sincere offer to send military troops to europe the only exception was france which seemed very interested in having chinese soldiers on the western front nevertheless despite all the misfortunes that china experienced in connection with its attempts to engage in the first world war the chinese people were excited and genuinely jubilant when the fighting ended with the allies’ victory when the news reached china the government immediately declared a threeday national holiday to commence upon the armistice furthermore china had achieved its original goal of being granted a seat at the postwar peace conference\\n\\nchina held high expectations for the paris peace conference the result however was deep disappointment many had hoped that president woodrow wilson whose fourteen points speech became an immediate best seller when published in china was the best qualified statesman to assume the role of champion of human rights generally and the rights of china in particular but the great powers – britain france and the usa – treated china unfairly and refused to return shandong instead allowing japan to take over german interests in china shandong was an integral part of chinese territory and was considered to be the cradle of chinese civilization the birthplace of confucius and mencius and a holy land for the chinese its inhabitants were entirely chinese in race language and religion most of the men who volunteered as labourers were from shandong\\n\\non 4 may 1919 thousands of students in beijing took to the streets to protest the decision their protest also placed pressure on the chinese government whom they believed had displayed weakness at the conference on 28 june 1919 the two chairs reserved for the chinese diplomatic delegation for the signing ceremony of the versailles treaty were empty china was the only nation which refused to sign the treaty by doing this it told the world that china refused to accept the new world order imposed by the western allies at peking university some cynically joked that wilson had discovered a jolting new formula with his idealistic world order ‘14  0’ by refusing to compromise on the shandong issue and by its refusal to sign the versailles treaty china forced the world to take notice of its situation and set the stage for the favorable resolution of the shandong problem at the washington conference in 1921–22\\n\\n1919 and after the may fourth movement and china’s turn towards communism\\nthe student protest on 4 may eventually became known as the may fourth movement and marked the end of china’s allout efforts to join the liberal western system the movement explicitly linked chinese domestic politics to international affairs and launched china’s search for an alternative world order and its place within it the movement conceived itself as the product of a double betrayal and a huge identity vacuum having first rejected their own traditions and civilization the chinese found their aspirations thwarted by the west this compelled the chinese to confront challenging questions what did it now mean to be chinese where was the country heading what values should the chinese government adopt in short what shape should china’s national identity take the key theme of the may fourth movement was to find a ‘third civilization’ for china to follow and copy\\n\\nthe socalled third civilization came in the form of russia in light of their dismal experience with westernstyle democracy after 1911 their rejection of confucian tradition and their disappointment after the war the chinese saw the alternative presented by communism and socialism from russia’s soviet regime as a clear solution to china’s problems the importance and impact of that fatal choice is still felt today since in theory china remains a communist country\\n\\nin short china’s involvement in the first world war truly made it a world war and transformed the meaning and implications of the conflict both for china and for the world its involvement injected new perspectives into the postwar peace conference and the emerging world order at the same time the broadly defined period of the great war signals the dawn of a new age for china and symbolizes the beginning of china’s long journey towards internationalisation propelling the country into a larger world history of the 20th century no matter how we evaluate china’s war contribution and effort by studying china’s involvement we can add a fuller – indeed even a new – dimension to our collective memory of the war and our intertwined histories\\n\\nfurther reading\\nxu guoqi china and the great

8919europe before 1914\\nconsidering factors such as globalization and military advancement professor david stevenson examines the political and diplomatic landscape of europe before the outbreak of world war one\\neurope in the early 20th century had known no great war involving all the continent’s major powers since the fall of napoleon although european society had been transformed in the interim the changes had made war more difficult rather than impossible and the underpinnings of the long 19thcentury peace had grown fragile\\nglobalization\\ncharacteristic of the pre1914 decades was what we would now call globalization trade may have risen from one thirtieth to one third of world production between 1800 and 1913 between 1855 and 1914 investment flows grew 20 times europe accounted for nearly two thirds of global trade and even more of global investment and from the 1890s europe’s major currencies were fixed in value in relation to each other under the international gold standard hundreds of thousands of foreignborn labourers worked in the heavy industries of french lorraine and germany’s ruhr the british writer norman angell in his 1909 bestseller europe’s optical illusion maintained that war between advanced modern economies was now irrational1 yet british naval planners saw economic interdependence as making germany more vulnerable and the german general staff considered war remained a viable option at least if victory came quickly\\n\\ndemocratization\\na second 19thcentury characteristic was democratization by 1914 all the european powers had elected lower houses of parliament and a majority of the adult male population was enfranchised the press was relatively free and citizens could form parties and pressure groups nonetheless in austriahungary germany and russia ministers answered to monarchs rather than to a parliamentary majority and the military chiefs were not subordinate to civilian statesmen moreover as international tension mounted public opinion polarized more moderate and progressive tendencies being offset by nationalism and militarism europe’s socialist parties opposed wars of conquest and aggression but were willing to endorse a war fought for just cause and in selfdefence which in 1914 all the governments would claim to be fighting\\n\\nmilitary revolutions\\nthe 19th century had also witnessed a succession of military revolutions at sea steel had superseded wooden hulls and steam had superseded sail hms dreadnought launched by britain in 1906 with turbine engines and 10 12inch guns made all existing battleships obsolete on land prussia’s combination of universal liability to conscription forward strategic planning by a general staff and railwayborne mobilization helped win the wars of german unification and was widely emulated breechloading cannon with rifled steel barrels replaced smoothbore muzzleloaders and infantry rifles replaced muskets smokeless high explosive replaced powder in bullets and shells and the modern field gun fired up to 20 rounds per minute yet although on balance these developments favoured defenders over attackers military planners concluded from the 190405 russojapanese war that offensive tactics could still prevail albeit at much higher cost than before\\n\\ninternational organization\\nwar therefore remained possible and the leading international political institution the concert of europe was too weak to prevent it the concert was not a permanent fixture but rather an understanding that at times of crisis the powers would try to resolve their differences peacefully through a conference of ambassadors it was a valuable facesaving device if governments wished to use it but in 1914 when britain proposed a conference germany encouraged austriahungary to refuse\\n\\na balance of power\\npeace therefore depended on more traditional devices such as the balance of power and deterrence in the 1870s and 1880s the newly unified german second empire under the chancellorship of otto von bismarck was not only the strongest continental military power but also spun a web of alliances that left france – resentful of its defeat in 1870 – isolated the austrogerman alliance of 1879 developed into the triple alliance including italy in 1882 and russia too concluded agreements with the germanled bloc but after wilhelm ii became emperor he allowed the connection with russia to lapse facilitating the formation in 189194 of a francorussian alliance even so for a time the two groupings balanced each other and russia and france were in rivalry not only with germany but also in central asia and in africa with britain so secure did germany still feel that from 1898 it too challenged britain through a major programme of north sea battleship building\\n\\nthe beginning of the 20th century\\nafter 190407 the lineup became more ominous russia was weakened for several years after its defeat by japan germany tried but failed to form a germanfrancorussian bloc excluding britain instead the british compromised over their extraeuropean disputes with the french in the ‘entente cordiale’ of 1904 and over those with the russians in 1907 and began cooperating diplomatically with their former adversaries in 1902 italy had reached a separate understanding with france germany’s leaders protested that the triple entente ‘encircled’ them while their one remaining reliable ally austriahungary was a multinational empire that was hobbled by interethnic disputes and menaced by a growing confrontation with its neighbour serbia which with russian encouragement fomented separatism among austriahungary’s south slavs after 1905 europe experienced a succession of diplomatic crises that heightened antagonism between the two blocs from 1912 the anglogerman naval race lost impetus as a land arms race between the austrogerman and francorussian alliances superseded it in retrospect it is easy to discern the warning signs but at the time they were less evident and as late as spring 1914 tensions seemed to be easing the french socialist leader jean jaurès believed the peaceful resolution of so many crises had bred a dangerous complacency nonetheless a general war was not inevitable until deliberate decisions created itweeks after arriving in germany yamashita was presented to adolf hitler the nazi leader each had his own objective for the meeting hitler intended to pressure the japanese military into declaring war on britain and the united states facing the wrath of russia and the ongoing costs of japan’s war on china however yamashita had no interest instead he hoped to inspect germany’s military techniques and improve japan’s own prospects at war despite hitler’s hearty promises of an open exchange of information the japanese delegation’s questions about radar and other equipment were tossed aside by top nazi officials the japanese were instead treated to a kind of “greatest hits” tour of german military sites around occupied territories\\nprivately yamashita was underwhelmed by the führer “he may be a great orator on a platform” he told staff “but standing behind his desk listening he seems much more like a clerk” nonetheless he played up the relationship publicly telling the berlin correspondent of the asahi newspaper that hitler had been profoundly influenced by japan’s military power since boyhood “hitler emphasized that in the coming age the interests of japan and germany would be identical as the two have common spiritual foundations” he said “hitler and mussolini are united with japan not from any consideration of interest but from a thorough spiritual understanding”\\n\\ngermany and japan had a mutual interest in gold\\nthe understanding may have been spiritual in part—but it was financial too in 1938 the third reich looted europe’s gold reserves giving germany as much as 100 metric tons of hard currency in the years that followed the nazis seized gold from central banks in poland belgium holland and the netherlands prompting the united kingdom to ship its gold to ottawa for safekeeping japan meanwhile seems to have plundered the rich gold resources of northeast china as well as other asian territories giving rise to later stories about vast hordes of treasure being hidden by yamashita in the philippines\\n\\nas the conflict continued and germany’s

opium metal and other raw materials to the nazi war machineexperiences of colonial troops\\n\\ndr santanu das gives an overview of the numbers and roles of colonial troops in world war one where did colonial troops serve and how was race used as a factor in military policy\\neven by conservative estimates well over four million nonwhite men were mobilised into the european and american armies during the first world war in combatant and noncombatant roles what do we know about the daily lived war experiences of these men from former colonies and from different racial and ethnic groups in spite of important work being done and the recent ‘global turn’ in first world war studies the social and cultural history of the war still continues to maintain a neat symmetry to the war itself the noneuropean aspects like the noneuropean sites of battle remain ‘sideshows’ the contours of the ‘great war and modern memory’ start to look different if instead of the writings of an ordinary european solider let alone a poet like wilfred owen or a novelist like erich maria remarque we consider the memories of an indian sepoy a chinese worker or an african askari\\n\\na world war\\nin 1906 in a fictional narrative the german writer f h grautoff warned that ‘a war in europe… must necessarily set the whole world ablaze’ this was no eurocentric boast in 1914 the whole of africa except ethiopia and liberia was under european rule and great britain and france controlled the two largest colonial empires they would draw on them extensively during the war for both human and material resources\\n\\namong the various colonies of the british empire india contributed the largest number of men with approximately 15 million recruited during the war up to december 1919 the dominions selfgoverning nations within the british commonwealth – including canada south africa australia new zealand and newfoundland – contributed a further 13 million men new zealand’s mobilisation of more than 100000 men may seem relatively small compared to india’s but in proportionate terms new zealand made one of the largest contributions to the british empire with five percent of its men aged 1549 killed indian and new zealand troops fought together in gallipoli where out of a total of 3000 indian combatants some 1624 were killed a loss rate of more than 50 per cent\\n\\nin addition to the 90000 troupes indigènes already under arms when the war started france recruited between 1914 and 1918 nearly 500000 colonial troops including 166000 west africans 46000 madagascans 50000 indochinese 140000 algerians 47000 tunisians and 24300 moroccans most of these french colonial troops served in europe however the majority of the africans served as labourers or carriers in africa in total as hew strachan has noted over 2 million africans were involved in the conflict as soldiers or labourers 10 percent of them died and among the labourers serving in africa the death rates may have been as high as 20 percent additionally nearly 140000 chinese contract labourers were hired by the british and french governments forming a substantial part of the immigrant labour force working in france during the war\\n\\nwith the entry of the united states into the war nearly 400000 africanamerican troops were inducted into the us forces of whom 200000 served in europe\\n\\nrace and military policy\\naccording to one native south african labourer the most remarkable part of his war experience was ‘to see the different kinds of human races from all parts of the world’ this racial diversity on european soil was largely the result of french and british decisions to employ colonial nonwhite troops against germany on the western front yet this decision was not straight forward in societies embedded with colour prejudices and doctrines of racial hierarchy  colour largely determined the life of the combatant and noncombatant in europe while france with its assimilationist model deployed these troops in europe a similar decision for great britain caused more soulsearching the times history of the world revealed contemporary thinking on the issue when in 1914 it wrote ‘the instinct which made us such sticklers for propriety in all our dealings made us more reluctant than other nations would feel to employ coloured troops against a white enemy’\\n\\nthe british had regularly used colonial troops for imperial defence but not in europe or against other white races indian troops were not allowed to fight in the boer war in south africa 1899 – 1902 if a ‘coloured’ man were trained to raise arms against another european what guarantee was there so the racial thinking went that he would not one day attack his own white master however after heavy casualties were suffered by the british expeditionary force in august 1914 two indian divisions were diverted to france among the colonial nonwhite troops of the british empire only indians were allowed to fight in europe this was predominantly due to racial categorisation in british military policy\\n\\nracial categorisation in the context of war assumed one of its most sinister forms in the theory of ‘martial races’ both england and france divided their subject people into ‘warlike’ and ‘nonwarlike’ races into races guerrières and races nonguerrières for british military recruitment this meant that some ‘races’ from nepal and the north indian provinces – particularly punjab – were more likely to be recruited to fight as they were considered inherently more ‘manly’ and warlike than men from other parts of india racial theory was similarly important to the french general  charles mangin and his theory of ‘la force noire’ the creation of a large reserve of african troops to counter france’s demographic imbalance in the face of germany to him west africans were ‘natural warriors’ ‘primitives… whose young blood flows so ardently as if avid to be shed’ but it was not only africans in combatant roles that suffered there has been important work on the use of carrier corps in subsaharan africa where men were reduced to ‘beasts of burden’ and suffered very high casualty rates as high as twenty percent often from disease and malnutrition many other ethnic groups were also used as labourers in the various theatres of war in recent years there has been some interest including an exhibition on the approximately 140000 chinese workers who were hired by the british and french governments to clear wwi battlefields\\n\\nfor the different dominions colonies and racial groups around the globe the war experience was profoundly transformative at different levels what are often considered sideshows in the grand european narrative of the war were momentous events with enduring consequences for the local communities nor for many of these groups did the war – at the basic physical level – end with the armistice for two weeks after the guns fell silent on the western front the wily german commander general paul von lettowvorbeck carried on his campaign in east africa in europe chinese labourers started clearing up the battlefields of the western front and french african troops stationed in the ruhr region until early 1921 became the target of vicious racist propaganda\\n\\nwhile in popular memory the perception of the first world war remains narrowly confined to the western front first world war fighting took place in europe africa and the middle east with brief excursions into central asia and the far east the litany of the names of different theatres of battle often becomes the marker for the ‘world’ nature of the first world war the colonial homefront – the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children in villages across asia and africa who lost their husbands brothers or fathers and faced different kinds of hardships – remains one of the most silent and underresearched areas in first world war history part of the problem is one of sources many of these people were nonliterate and have not left us with the diaries and memoirs that we have in europe however the global reverberations of this ‘world war’ become apparent when we consider the experiences of people both men and women combatants and noncombatants from around the world who fought or laboured or whose lives were changed forever because of the war\\n\\nadapted from the ‘introduction’ to race empire and first world war writing edited by santanu das cambridge 2011\\n\\nhow the first world war ended \\nprofessor david stevenson explains how the war came to an end and why germany accepted the harsh terms of the armistice\\nto understand how and why the first world war terminated we should remember why it failed to end sooner in its middle years the conflict became a triple stalemate at once military neither side could achieve a breakthrough diplomatic the two sides’ objectives diverged too widely to allow peace through compromise and domestic political until the bolshevik revolution of november 1917 governments in all the great power belligerents remained committed to victory in contrast on the eastern front the crucial development which enabled soviet russia’s withdrawal from the war formalised by the signing of the brestlitovsk peace treaty of march 1918 was that a majority of the bolshevik leaders was willing to concede all the central powers’ demands rather than risk being overthrown in any case much of the russian army deserted after the bolshevik takeover rendering organised resistance impossible even so the brestlitovsk treaty did not halt operations in the summer of 1918 the central powers overran the baltic coast ukraine and the crimea and sent troops to finland and georgia right up until november hundreds of thousands of their forces stayed in the east\\nthe end of the war in western europe\\nby contrast in western europe the key variable that changed was military once the strategic balance shifted decisively germany applied for a ceasefire and for a peace settlement based on the american president woodrow wilson ’s ‘fourteen points’ of january 1918 which germany had initially rejected only after the german government had publicly admitted that the war could not be won did revolution follow and rule out further resistance to the victors’ terms\\n\\ngermany in 1918 was not a dictatorship but the army high command paul von hindenburg as chief of the general staff and erich ludendorff as first quartermastergeneral held a veto over key decisions in foreign policy wilhelm ii feared confronting them and by threatening to resign they could remove officials whom they thought too moderate the key development on the road to the armistice therefore came on 28 september when ludendorff suffered a breakdown that evening he told hindenburg that an early ceasefire was imperative and hindenburg agreed ludendorff had been under strain for months but developments in the balkans france and in the german army precipitated his collapse\\n\\nthe trigger was a ceasefire appeal by germany’s smallest partner starting on 15 september allied forces in macedonia had attacked and routed the bulgarian army if bulgaria dropped out the central powers would geographically split in two separating ottoman turkey from austriahungary and germany in addition allied forces could threaten the ploesti oilfield in romania bulgaria therefore mattered in its own right but it surrendered partly because of wider developments in the war german and austrohungarian forces had withdrawn from macedonia to fight elsewhere and the balkan crisis coincided with a larger crisis on the western front between march and july 1918 five german allout assaults – the ‘ludendorff offensives’ – had advanced up to 50 miles 80 kilometres towards the channel ports and paris but compelled neither britain nor france to make peace before the american army arrived in strength between july and november the allies drove germany back expelling it from most of france and much of belgium on 26 september allied forces opened a sequence of attacks along a huge sector between the argonne forest and flanders and on 29 september british empire troops broke through the strongest german defence position the hindenburg line the german army could neither overwhelm its enemies in an allout offensive nor halt their advance through defensive attrition the situation on the western front had altered fundamentally since the stalemate of 1915–17\\n\\nallied advantages\\ntechnology was one factor the allies possessed hundreds of tanks against germany’s dozens the german high command cited tanks as one reason why a ceasefire was needed they were used in massed attacks on the marne on 18 july and near amiens on 8 august yet the tanks advanced only at walking pace and were vulnerable to breakdown and to german fire they were a supplementary advantage rather than a warwinning weapon more important was allied artillery this meant particularly heavy guns which could destroy trenches and dugouts and if guided by aerial reconnaissance and photographs could silence germany’s guns by surprise bombardments at the same time lighter fieldgun batteries laid down a ‘creeping barrage’ that stifled the german machine guns until the allied infantry were upon them the british and french possessed a flexible logistical system that used roads as well as railways enabling them to shuttle forces rapidly from sector to sector whereas by late september germany’s lateral trunk line was paralysed behind the barbed wire lay the home fronts where british and french factories delivered machine guns artillery gas tanks and aircraft in extraordinary quantities backed by american oil steel machinery and finance equally crucial was command of the atlantic across which north american troops and commodities were transported in 1917 the uboats threatened to starve britain into surrender by 1918 they were contained\\n\\na further allied advantage was in ‘manpower’ as it was called at the time britain and france had greater success than germany in recruiting women to make munitions the german army had to release hundreds of thousands of troops into arms production during 1918 the german army suffered a million casualties in the offensives from march to july and nearly as many again between july and november although britain and france were also running short of soldiers american military personnel in france rose between march and november from some 250000 to nearly two million the german army was not only outnumbered but also demoralised tens of thousands of its troops surrendered every month from august onwards while comparable numbers deserted\\n\\nagreeing the terms of peace\\nludendorff feared that if revolution followed defeat the soldiers would refuse to keep order his response was to seek damage limitation he hoped to win a breathing space and regroup advised by the foreign minister paul von hintze he envisaged appealing not to germany’s enemies collectively but to the american president whom the germans thought the weak link in the opposing chain they asked wilson for a ceasefire prior to a peace based on the fourteen points his moderate and idealistic peace programme announced in january 1918 and on his other speeches they stagemanaged a ‘revolution from above’ forming a government under prince max of baden who had a reputation as a liberal and including the socialist catholic and progressive parties who commanded a reichstag majority wilson responded by engaging with the germans in a public exchange of notes while consulting the european allies privately eventually not only did the germans sign up to the fourteen points but so apparently did britain france and italy at the paris conference of 29 october–4 november just as it had taken two sides to start the war so too all the parties had to be persuaded that stopping the conflict was in their interests even so it is less surprising that the germans requested a ceasefire than that the americans and the european allies conceded one when at last the military operations were moving their way\\n\\npart of the explanation for this paradox is that america britain and france were wary of each other as well as of their enemies and all saw arguments against continuing into 1919 in washington the issue was partly financial treasury secretary william g mcadoo warned that the war was becoming prohibitively expensive even for america moreover wilson faced midterm elections in which his democratic party was likely to lose ground to his republican critics he feared the xenophobia of the american home front would hamper him in brokering a moderate peace this would apply still more if germany were so completely beaten that britain and france no longer needed american assistance in europe in contrast italy would follow a francobritish lead and both paris and london feared that a victory won in 1919 would be dominated by america which would gain a corresponding dominance at the peace conference and although wilson insisted on the fourteen points becoming the political framework of the armistice he left the technical terms to the european allies the naval terms were shaped by the british admiralty which insisted on germany surrendering all its submarines and its most modern battleships the land terms were decided mainly by the allied generalinchief ferdinand foch who required the germans to withdraw so quickly that they abandoned much of their heavy equipment enabling the allies to occupy belgium a central british concern alsacelorraine a central french one and the west bank of the rhine as well as bridgeheads on the east bank furthermore germany had to abandon all its gains in russia while the italians under their ceasefire with austria could occupy trieste and the trentino germany had also to evacuate german east africa the one overseas colony where its forces continued to resist the european allies used the peace agreement to install their forces in the territories to which they had pretensions and to weaken germany to such an extent that it could not renew hostilities\\n\\nwhy did germany accept an armistice with such severe terms\\nthe question remains why germany accepted terms that were much less favourable than hindenburg and ludendorff had envisaged part of the answer is that wilhelm ii dismissed ludendorff on 17 october while ordering hindenburg to stay in post and thereby splitting the two generals as ludendorff was replaced by the more conciliatory and realistic wilhelm groener the military veto over foreign policy was lifted ludendorff lost credibility with the german politicians by urging them to reject an armistice once he realised its conditions would be severe and wilson’s pressure for democratisation within germany may also have contributed to the change in the high command two further developments completed the destruction of berlin’s bargaining position the first was a series of nationalist revolutions in austriahungary at the end of october poland czechoslovakia and yugoslavia emerged at the former dual monarchy’s expense while the remainders of its austrian and hungarian halves separated on 31 october ottoman turkey also signed a ceasefire partly because bulgaria’s surrender had opened the road for allied armies to reach istanbul if germany fought on now it would do so alone but the final blow was revolution in germany itself it began when the navy prepared a suicidal final sortie against the thames estuary and london once the battleships began to get up steam their crews mutinied the warships put in to shore at kiel and the sailors joined hands with munitions workers to raise the red flag revolution spread across north germany and on 9 november a republic was proclaimed in berlin under a socialist provisional government while wilhelm fled into exile groener advised the new authorities to conclude a ceasefire on any terms available which they did\\n\\nthe armistice offered germany apparently lenient political terms based on the fourteen points but stringent naval and military conditions almost immediately some allied leaders felt the war had been halted too soon – as the american commander john j pershing had warned before the ceasefire was signed germany’s forces still stood everywhere on foreign territory and only four months previously its territorial conquests had reached their maximum german nationalists soon propagated the myth that the defeat was bogus and that german jews and communists as well as the socialist provisional government had stabbed the warrior heroes in the back if the allies had demanded unconditional surrender or had paraded through berlin they might have hammered home that germany really had been beaten undercutting the far right yet at the time none of the allied political chiefs wished to occupy the german interior in the preceasefire discussions pershing had been countered by foch who warned that fighting on would cost tens of thousands of lives for advantages that were nebulous indeed the armistice conditions weakened germany sufficiently for the allies to be able seven months later to impose the versailles treaty over vehement german opposition and if the victors had held together to uphold the treaty’s disarmament clauses no second world war need have followed but this was for the future in november 1918 leaders in washington paris and london judged that now that fighting no longer served a political purpose no further loss of life was justified and the bloodshed they had endured for so long could finally come to an endmilitary discipline and punishment\\n\\nprofessor gary sheffield discusses conformity and rebellion of world war one troops within the frame of military discipline and punishment\\none of the factors that enabled the soldiers of the first world war to endure terrible conditions and high casualties was discipline military discipline makes the difference between a mob and an army it is a form of behaviour that is the consequence of training and indoctrination designed to ensure compliance to orders among individuals and groups to create and maintain cohesion in military units the fact that the undermining of officers’ authority in russia after the march revolution 1917 was an issue in the mass desertions that followed offers evidence that discipline is the glue that holds groups together and makes them act as one in response to orders\\nbrutal training to mould an army\\narmies in the first world war drew upon a pool of recruits some of which were already accustomed to industrial discipline in factories and other workplaces germany and britain for example were highly industrialised and urbanised societies in 1914 all workingclass soldiers would have been used to being at the bottom of society with all that entailed even so all armies subjected new recruits to basic training which ranged from the unpleasant to the brutal the aim being to break down the individuality of the new soldiers and to mould them into a group that would carry out orders unquestioningly\\n\\nconformity versus rebellion\\ndiscipline was operated with a carrotandstick approach conforming brought benefits regular food leave and other privileges rebelling incurred punishments which differed from army to army most were fairly minor stoppage of privileges giving offenders unpleasant or dangerous duties british empire forces used field punishment the most severe version including tying a malefactor to a fixed object for a period of time although much resented this was more humane than the traditional punishment of flogging which was still used on indian troops as an emergency measure the russian army reintroduced flogging in 1915 imprisonment was a possibility although as it this offered a way out of the trenches it tended to be used sparingly\\nmutiny desertion and the ultimate punishment\\nmutiny was the gravest military crime for it struck at the very heart of military discipline and desertion was not far behind for similar reasons nearly all armies executed malefactors sometimes the purpose was to act as a warning or deterrent to others with the justice of sentences passed on individuals of less importance than the disciplinary needs of the army there were certainly cases perhaps numerous ones of psychiatric casualties soldiers who have sustained mental wounds being shot civilian justice and military discipline served two different purposes\\n\\ngermany used the ultimate penalty sparingly only 48 of 150 death sentences were carried out the numbers shot by the french army are unknown as they included some summary executions but the shooting of 600 out of 2000 condemned are documented however in the aftermath of the mutinies of 1917 while 554 men were sentenced to death only 49 were executed the british executed 321 for military offences plus an unknown number of indian soldiers the australian government refused to allow death sentences to be carried out on their men otherwise subject to british military law punishments were particularly savage in the italian army they included ‘decimation’ choosing soldiers by lot from a unit that had failed in some way and executing them a favoured policy of general luigi cardona it was discontinued by his successor as de facto commanderinchief general armando diaz seeking to restore the morale of the army after the disaster at caporetto in 1917 some 750 italian soldiers were shot\\n\\nconclusion\\ndiscipline was an important factor in holding armies together but it was not the only one depending on the army and the individual belief in the cause loyalty to unit andor comrades leadership and other issues were also significant in 1918 austrian soldiers were deterred from deserting because they decided that the army’s meagre rations were preferable to facing famine at home nevertheless without the bonds of discipline armies could not have stayed in the field for as long as they did\\nprisoners of war\\n\\nwhat was the reality for prisoners of war in world war one dr heather jones looks beyond the propaganda to consider the facts around prisoner mistreatment labour and death rates across europe\\nthe image of prisoners behind barbed wire gazing at the camera taking their photograph is a striking one prisoners of war were central to the propaganda machine in the first world war with belligerent states keen to circulate photographs that showed that they were treating their captives well how a state treated its prisoners was taken as an indication of its level of cultural development and modernity – and all states accused their enemy of mistreating its prisoners\\n\\nprisoner mistreatment\\nthese accusations were not all propaganda stories although the majority of the estimated eight to nine million men taken prisoner during the first world war survived the conflict during the war there were a number of serious episodes of prisoner mistreatment in 1914 germany captured far more prisoners of war than britain or france by 1915 germany held over a million prisoners of war germany expected a short war and it was not prepared for these numerous soldiers captured on both germany’s eastern and western fronts in 1914 prisoners of war transported to germany from the front often had to sleep in fields where they suffered from exposure while they waited for their camps to be built the prisoners were also used as labour to build the camps\\n\\nin germany austriahungary and russia in 1915 prisoner of war camps were often unsanitary and that year a severe typhus epidemic broke out which cost the lives of thousands of prisoners in mauthausen camp in austriahungary in january 1915 up to 186 prisoners a day died of typhus typhus also broke out in many camps in camps in the russian empire in winter 191516 typhus ravaged totskoe camp where at least 10000 men died out of 25000 the typhus epidemic led to the development of better hygiene conditions in prisoner of war camps in germany with modern latrines disinfection vats to remove lice from clothing and shower or bath houses built for the prisoners\\n\\nreprisals also resulted in prisoner mistreatment in 1916 germany sent newly captured british and french prisoners to carry out forced labour on the eastern front in a reprisal action for the french sending german prisoners of war to camps in north africa and the british using german prisoners as workers for the british army in france these eastern front reprisals were horrific and many prisoners died of cold and starvation in 1917 germany kept british and french prisoners of war on the western front in dangerous locations carrying out forced labour this was a reprisal for the british and french using forced german prisoner labour on the western front the french had forced german prisoners to work under shellfire for months on the verdun battlefield these reprisals marked a significant escalation in prisoner of war\\n\\nlabour\\nthe image of prisoners of war behind barbed wire in the prisoner of war camp was one of the most widespread images of the war however it was also rather misleading as by 1915 states and armies had started to think differently about how best to house and treat prisoners the large prisoner of war camp on a country’s home front was only one place that prisoners were held from 1915 on germany began to send prisoners to live and work in small working units in agriculture forestry or mining – industries badly short of manpower due to the war effort russia and france also began to use prisoner labour on a massive scale in russia working conditions varied very widely with the worst occurring during the construction of the murman railway during which an estimated 25000 out of the 70000 mainly austrohungarian and german prisoner of war work force died britain however delayed using widespread prisoner labour on the home front until 1917 because of trade union opposition\\n\\nprisoner labour was key to the war effort of many states overall by 1916 across europe most nonofficer prisoners of war whom it was legal for the captor to put to work under international law were working some returning to the prisoner of war camp at night others lodged under guard near to their place of work for those housed outside the camp conditions could vary considerably while prisoner of war camps were inspected during the war by the international red cross  working units outside the camp were rarely inspected the worst camps however were those run by armies near the front line by 1916 the british french german austrohungarian and russian armies were all keeping permanent units of prisoners as forced labourers for the army at or near the front these men had to work under shellfire and live in desolate unhygienic conditions in some armies such as the german army in 1918 they were\\n\\ndeath rates\\ndeath rates varied for different prisoner nationalities during the war 100000 of the 600000 italian prisoners captured by the central powers died romanian prisoners in german camps had a death rate of 29 serbs held by austriahungary or british prisoners captured by the ottoman empire also had very high death rates in contrast german prisoners captured by britain had death rates of 3 while most prisoners survived the war and camps in western european countries were generally quite good for certain nationalities captivity was more dangerous than serving at the front the image of the wellrun prisoner of war camp is thus not representative of the experience of all prisoners during the warpropaganda for patriotism and nationalism\\n\\nprofessor david welch explores nations’ reliance on propaganda in world war one with a focus on symbols and slogans of nationhood and patriotism\\n\\nthe first world war was the first war in which the mass media played a significant part in disseminating news from the fighting front to the home front it was also the first war to target systematically produced government propaganda at the general public all the belligerents were therefore compelled to recognise that they had to justify the righteousness of the war and to this end themes such as patriotism and nationalism played an important role\\n‘your country needs you’\\nthe armies of continental europe were made up of conscripts who really had little choice about going to war in 1914 the british army by contrast was made up of professionals and then volunteers the british placed immense reliance therefore on propaganda to justify the war to the people to help promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince the population that their sacrifices would be rewarded  one of the most enduring images of the war   much copied and parodied since  remains the distinctive recruitment poster of lord kitchener’s heavily mustachioed face and intimidating finger imploring the british population that ‘your country needs you’ stereotypes deeply embedded in national sentiment were invoked to justify britain’s entry into the war and british propaganda posters often employed the religious symbolism of st george slaying the german dragonbritish recruitment posters changed in tone from appealing to an individual’s honour to ‘mobilisation by shame’ savile lumley’s famous poster of 1915 depicted two young children asking their father about his military prowess after the war ‘daddy what did you do in the great war’ the emotional blackmail of using children to shame their elders into fighting was in fact employed by most of the belligerents women were also assigned the responsibility for ordering men into war perhaps the most well known in this genre is ‘women of britain say—“go”’\\n\\nsymbols of nationhood\\nonce the initial euphoria ‘war fever’ had subsided it was imperative to remind people both at home and in the trenches of what they were fighting for the major themes included a call to arms and a request for war loans as well as efforts to encourage industrial activity to explain national policies to channel emotions such as courage or hatred to urge the population to conserve resources and to inform the public of food and fuel substitutes\\none tactic at a state’s disposal was the use of iconic figures to strengthen a particular point about national identity in order to promote patriotism these might be real people presented in a mythologised form as national heroes or they might come from old myths or popular folklore britannia john bull and the british bulldog the german eagle the french cockerel or the national emblem of france marianne   an allegorical encapsulation of liberty and reason\\n\\nan alternative strategy was the use of material symbols of nationhood indeed a state might have numerous opportunities at its disposal to create narratives and circulate images favourable to its preferred national story  in everyday items such as coins banknotes and postage stamps or symbolic structures such as statues monuments and buildings two of the most overt and powerful symbols which allow citizens to express their affinity with the state are the nation’s flag and its anthem\\n\\nthe money motif\\nthe need to raise money to pay for the war by means of war bonds or ‘liberty bonds’ as they were known in the united states provided one of the most important patriotic themes for posters and for the new medium of film  a recurring related theme was the portrayal of money coins and banknotes as an active force in military engagement for example ‘turn your silver into bullets  at the post office’ in france a similar poster designed by jules abel faivre in 1915 depicted a large gold coin with a gallic cockerel on it crushing a german soldier with the slogan ‘deposit your gold for france  gold fights for victory’\\n\\nall sides therefore supplemented their military engagement with propaganda aimed at stimulating national sentiment by means of nationalistic slogans and patriotic calls to armsthe war at sea\\n\\nin the leadup to world war one britain and germany were engaged in a naval arms race archivist louise bruton examines how the war heralded a new form of naval warfare that featured dreadnoughts submarines and trade blockades\\nin the years leading up to the first world war britain and germany engaged in a naval arms race britain had peaceably enjoyed its status as the world’s dominant naval force since the napoleonic wars but germany now sought to contest that dominance a new generation of ships became central to the naval race the dreadnoughts named after the royal navy’s hms dreadnought these ‘castles of steel’ came to symbolise naval power in the early 20th century\\n\\nthe dreadnoughts represented a revolution in warship design and yet their construction was based on the centuriesold definition of the purpose of naval campaigning as being the headon confrontation of two opposing battle fleets during the first world war not only did senior naval officers trained in the days of sail learn to command brand new ships and weaponry untested in wartime they also witnessed a transformation in warfare that turned the war at sea from a traditional surface encounter into a complex balancing act of defensive strategies and covert tactics involving two new and unforeseen dimensions under water and in the air1\\n\\n\\ntrade blockade of germany\\nbritain was quick to capitalise on its enduring naval supremacy and geographical position by establishing a trade blockade of germany and its allies as soon as war began the royal navy’s grand fleet patrolled the north sea laid mines and cut off access to the channel curtailing the movements of the german high seas fleet and preventing merchant ships from supplying germany with raw materials and food the north sea became ‘a marine no man’s land with the british fleet bottling up the exits’ as richard hough describes it in the great war at sea 191419182\\n\\nthe effect of the blockade on germany’s civilians after four years of war was noted by british army majorgeneral sir aylmer gould hunterweston in december 1918 during a visit to germany ‘the food situation is very serious indeed…the germans are living entirely on their food capital now – they have eaten all their laying hens and are eating all their milch sic cows… there is a real scarcity’\\nsubmarine warfare and defensive strategy \\nthe simultaneous torpedoing of hms aboukir hogue and cressy by a single german submarine in september 1914 shocked the royal navy and forced the admiralty to recognise the threat that the uboats as they became known posed to the surface fleet3\\n\\nalthough the allies had their own submarines which were active in the adriatic the baltic and the dardanelles over the course of the war defences against submarines were slow to be developed the british navy appealed both to its own personnel and to the wider public for ideas minefields net barrages depth charges and patrols were introduced but more often than not these defences could be evaded uboats could roam virtually undetected since the sighting of a periscope was the most reliable method of location at a time when sonar technology was still in its infancy\\n\\nin january 1916 in reply to an enquiry from former prime minister and then first lord of the admiralty arthur balfour commanderinchief of the grand fleet john rushworth jellicoe stressed the importance of playing to the navy’s main strength – its size – to retain control of the north sea ‘…as to a possible naval offensive… i have long arrived at the conclusion that it would be suicidal to divide our main fleet’ for the first two years of the war the allies accordingly concentrated their naval efforts on a defensive strategy of protecting trade routes developing antisubmarine devices and maintaining the blockade rather than actively seeking direct confrontation\\n\\natmosphere of frustration\\ndefence was a vital strategy but it was also gruelling repetitive and unglamorous many in the navy longed for decisive action and a great naval victory to recall the battle of trafalgar and gratify the general public the minor battles of the heligoland bight and dogger bank and the disastrous dardanelles campaign did little to ease the tension first sea lord admiral h b jackson commented to jellicoe ‘i fancy you must look out for staleness sic with your important commanders just as much as general health i do wish you could get a change in your monotonous work’\\n\\nthe battle of jutland\\njackson’s wish was granted on 31 may1 june 1916 when the grand fleet finally met the high seas fleet in direct combat off the coast of denmark the battle of jutland was to be the only major naval battle of the first world war and the most significant encounter between warships of the dreadnought era \\n\\nwith fewer ships germany’s plan was to divide and conquer a german advance force led by viceadmiral franz hipper engaged viceadmiral david beatty’s battlecruisers hoping to cut them off from the main fleet a fire fight ensued as beatty chased hipper hipper leading beatty towards the rest of the high seas fleet the allies suffered early casualties in the loss of hms indefatigable and queen mary before beatty turned to rejoin the grand fleet the high seas fleet and the grand fleet clashed throughout the afternoon until darkness descended during the night the high seas fleet made its escape and by the early hours of 1 june the battle was over\\n\\nboth sides claimed the battle as a victory germany had inflicted greater losses on the allies than it had suffered itself and yet the high seas fleet was incapacitated while the grand fleet remained the dominant naval factor however controversy over jellicoe’s and beatty’s actions quickly followed the battle and deprived both the royal navy and the british public of the outright triumph that years of frustration had called for it is telling that jellicoe’s parting words to his navy colleagues on leaving the grand fleet a few months later read ‘may your arduous work be crowned with a glorious victory’\\n\\nunrestricted submarine warfare and the convoy system\\nafter the battle of jutland the high seas fleet never again attempted to engage the entire grand fleet and german naval strategy refocused on covert underwater operations\\n\\nsubmarine historian richard comptonhall suggests that the starvation of the german population due to the allied blockade had a decisive influence on uboat crews’ increasingly ruthless attacks culminating in the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 february 1917 4 uboats attacked merchant vessels hoping to disrupt allied trade and similarly weaken britain an island nation dependent on its imports\\n\\nthe result was huge loss of life in the merchant navy and a shortage of british shipping with which shipbuilders could not keep pace neutral ships were not immune and neither were passenger liners rms lusitania had been sunk by a uboat in 1915 killing american passengers and prompting some to call for us entry into the war the renewed threat to civilians caused the usa to declare war in april 1917 a month in which 869000 tons of allied shipping was sunk5\\n\\na letter from the board of trade to the cabinet in april 1916 had predicted that ‘…the shortage of shipping will place this country in more serious peril than can any calamity short of the defeat of the navy…’ with the grand fleet undefeated it became clear that the war would be won or lost not in a traditional sea battle but by the allies’ response to the socalled ‘submarine menace’\\n\\nthe allied response was a system of convoys warships escorted merchant and passenger vessels protecting them from uboat attack by virtue of strength in numbers the concentration of shipping into small clusters in vast seas made ships harder rather than easier to find evasive zigzag courses made it difficult for uboats to predict convoy routes and target torpedoes and the accompanying warships were able to counterattack using depth charges the royal naval air service rnas and later the us naval air service provided cover spotting submerged uboats and thereby deterring them from surfacing and accurately targeting the convoy shipping losses dropped and by the time of the armistice in 1918 the loss rate in the convoys was less than 05 per cent6\\n\\nconclusion\\nthe war at sea was not characterised by monumental battles glorious victories and haunting landscapes as was the war on land the battle of jutland was the only fullscale direct action to occur between opposing navies and even this was indecisive yet the blockade of supplies to germany weakened the country directly contributing to the end of the war as indeed the uboat campaign would have done in reverse had the convoy system not eventually succeeded in saving britain from starvation control of the north sea meant no less than the difference between independence and invasion \\n\\nthe war at sea was a test of nerves and ingenuity both sides had to master technologies and ways of fighting unimaginable just a few years earlier it was a marathon of endurance and persistence often thankless but always critically importantthe sahara buried this ancient roman city—preserving it for centuries\\n\\nit isn’t often that entire cities vanish but the roman outpost of thamugadi did founded by the emperor trajan around ad 100 the city also known as timgad or tamugas was located in the north african province of mumidia\\n\\nhome to veterans of the third augustan legion thamugadi flourished for hundreds of years becoming prosperous and thus an attractive target for raiders after a vandal invasion in 430 repeated attacks weakened the city which never fully recovered and was abandoned during the 700s\\n\\nthe desert sands swept in and buried thamugadi one thousand years would pass before the city received a visit from a team of explorers led by a maverick scotsman in the 1700s see also this warrior was the best of ancient romes five good emperors\\n\\nstatesman and scholar\\nbest known now for his contested discovery of the source of the blue nile in ethiopia scottish nobleman james bruce was serving as the british consul in the coastal city of algiers today the capital of algeria in 1763\\n\\nimposingly tall and broad bruce was a voracious scholar with a curious mind before his arrival in algiers to take up his post he spent a few months in italy poring over the history of the african region and its role in antiquity\\n\\nbruce’s short temper and strong opinions soon led to clashes with his superiors in london in 1765 he lost his appointment rather than return to britain he and a florentine artist named luigi balugani embarked on an adventure across africa on their journey they kept notes and made illustrations depicting the many extraordinary people and places they encountered\\n\\n\\ntime in the desert\\nin the early stages of this odyssey they had traveled south to the algerian desert looking for traces of ancient civilizations bruce and balugani had already seen several roman ruins as they explored more remote parts of the region\\n\\non december 12 1765 they reached what they identified as thamugadi many believe that they were the first europeans in centuries to visit the site near the northern slopes of the aurès mountains “it has been a small town but full of elegant buildings” bruce wrote in his diaries he was confident that these ruins were what remained of the city founded by trajan more than a millenium earlier\\n\\non the first day bruce recorded and balugani drew “the triumphal arch” of trajan they returned the next day to continue exploration and identified an amphitheater bruce cleared away the sand and uncovered sculptures of the roman emperor who succeeded hadrian in ad 138 antoninus pius and his wife faustina the elder works he described as having “exquisite beauty” see also trajans column soars over rome\\n\\nbruce reburied the sculptures in the sand and continued traveling he documented more sites throughout north africa and ethiopia even claiming to find the source of the blue nile balugani died in 1770 and bruce returned to london in 1774 when he reported his findings they were greeted with skepticism and disbelief incredulous at this reaction bruce retired to scotland in 1780 he began writing a memoir of his time in africa a fivevolume work known as travels to discover the source of the nile the book was published in 1790 when bruce died four years later much of britain still refused to recognize his achievements\\n\\nroman splendor\\nthamugadi lay largely forgotten in the desert sands until 1875 when it was visited by robert lambert playfair britain’s consul in algiers in his 1877 book travels in the footsteps of bruce in algeria and tunis playfair paid homage to his consular predecessor visiting some of the sites bruce had recorded\\n\\nplayfair’s description of thamugadi offers more details than bruce’s his observations revealed the city’s regional importance noting it was built at the intersection of six roman roads in playfair’s opinion the architecture outshone that of the neighboring roman city lambaesis nubia’s military capital playfair concluded that thamugadi was a “center of commercial and agricultural activity” see also on this ancient map all roads really do lead to rome\\n\\nhe also admired the magnificence of the city’s arch of trajan on the ground underneath its 20foothigh portal can still be seen deep ruts from the traffic that passed into the city along the busy imperial highways\\n\\nthe french took control of the site in 1881 a few years after playfair’s visit and maintained a presence there until 1960 during this period the site was systematically excavated having been buried for centuries under sand with nothing built on top of it thamugadi is one of only a few roman cities excavated in its entirety\\n\\ngoing with the grain\\nthe research undertaken by playfair and by french scholars has enabled historians to piece together the history of the city originally named colonia marciana trajana thamurga in honor of emperor trajan’s sister thamugadi was laid out in a grid\\n\\nin the midthird century ad the city’s population peaked at 15000 they enjoyed fine public buildings including a magnificent library and a total of 14 baths the comfort of thamugadi’s facilities and the presence of mosaics has often prompted comparisons with pompeii see also vesuvius asleep for now\\n\\nthe city’s location was key to protecting the roman empire’s southern borders north africa was a center of grain production and rome’s third augustan legion was stationed in thamugadi to protect the grain and its transport to rome several hundred men would be discharged from the legion every two years and they settled in thamugadi as a kind of pension for their service their presence also served as a deterrent to invaders\\n\\nthe city was a manifestation of roman might on the empire’s southern border its diverse population saw those who worshipped the old gods living alongside christians for a while it was a stronghold of the heretical christian sect the donatists\\n\\nthe general crisis mounting on the borders of the roman empire eventually took its toll on thamugadi after being looted by the vandals during the fifth century the city began to sink into ruin after the fall of the western roman empire thamugadi enjoyed a brief resurgence as a christian center and a fort was built outside the city in 539 but the city was abandoned either before or during the arab invasions of the 700s see also romes border walls were the beginning of its end\\n\\nfrom that point the sahara gradually covered thamugadi and it stayed hidden for a thousand years until james bruce and others would rediscover its buried glory thamugadi was designated as a unesco world heritage site in 1982the inheritance of empire and the ruins of rome in french colonial algeria\\n\\nin 1912 albert ballu chief architect of the service des monuments historiques de l’algérie described the ‘triple task’ of the service which had been established in 1880—fifty years after the beginning of france’s conquest of algeria—as that of not only excavating the ‘secrets’ that the ground contained but also of ‘making them presentable to the public’ and of ‘preserving them from destruction’ 1 france was not alone in embarking on this archaeological project that sought to explore an antique and more particularly a roman past in the nineteenth and early twentieth century but algeria came to occupy a special place in the french historical imagination

city was initially populated by a colony of roman soldiers from italy and eventually grew to become a large trading market the resources that contributed to the prosperity of the city were essentially agricultural cereals olive trees and farm\\n\\nduring the reign of caracalla in the 3rd century cuiculs administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum they surrounded it with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum the terrain hindered building so that they built the theatre outside the town walls which was exceptional\\n\\nchristianity became very popular in the 4th century after some persecutions in the early third century2 and brought the addition of a basilica and baptistry they are to the south of

                american lung association \\n     a new study published by the american lung association has shown that \\nsurprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with \\nasthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment  \\n     the seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits \\nfor asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution  \\nthe actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed \\nunsafe under federal air quality laws  \\n     people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to \\nexacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz phd of the environmental \\nprotection agency who was the lead author of the study  when people are on \\nthe threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over \\nthe edge \\n     the seattle study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits \\nwith daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \\nof 10 microns or less  these finer particles are considered hazardous because \\nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung  cities are considered out of \\ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24hour average concentration of pm10 \\nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air  \\n     in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \\nlevels as low as 30 micrograms  the authors concluded that for every 30 \\nmicrogram increase in the fourday average of pm10 the odds of someone with \\nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent  \\n     the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory \\ndisease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung \\nassociations medical section  \\n     the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \\nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat  a 1992 study \\nby dr schwartz and douglas dockery phd of harvard found that particles \\nmay be causing roughly 60000 premature deaths each year in the united states  \\nother studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \\nand bronchitis in children  \\n     government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone \\nsays dr schwartz  but more and more research is showing that particles are \\nbad actors as well      one problem in setting standards for particulate \\nair pollution is that pmio is difficult to study  unlike other regulated \\npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate

we have no way of \\nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles   consequently most of what \\nis known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research \\nlike the seattle study  \\n     given that the epas current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \\ndioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any \\ntime soon  until changes are made there appears to be little people with \\nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles\\n     in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only \\ncover the

cancer centers 14 are of the basic science type  \\nthese centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers \\nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \\nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \\nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory \\nclinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and \\nclinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently \\nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \\noverall research programs  there are 12 such centers today \\nfinally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely \\nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \\ncontrol research  these centers interface with state and local public health \\ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \\nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \\nresponsible for implementing populationwide public health programs  \\nconsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \\ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \\nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials \\ntogether the 55 ncidesignated cancer centers continue to work toward \\ncreating

cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the \\napproximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986 \\ntable 1 the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among \\n21 reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico 1 this \\nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdcs national hospital \\ndischarge survey nhds for 1991 and compares these data with previous years \\n     data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been \\ncollected annually since 1965 in the nhds conducted by cdcs national center \\nfor health statistics for 1991 medical and demographic information were \\nabstracted from a sample of 274000 inpatients discharged from 484 \\nparticipating hospitals the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \\ncesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national \\nestimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31000 11 women discharged \\nafter delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \\ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from \\nnational vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of \\ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \\nsolely on the nhds 2 stated differences in this analysis are significant at \\nthe 95 confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value \\nof 196 \\n     in 1991 there were 235 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as \\nin 1990 and similar to rates during 19861989 table 1 the primary cesarean \\nrate ie number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \\nprevious cesareans for 19861991 also was stable ranging from 168 to 175 \\nin 1991 the cesarean rate in the south was 276 significantly p005 \\nhigher than the rates for the west 198 midwest 218 and northeast \\n226 rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \\nthan for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \\ngovernment hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \\nhospitals and for deliveries for which blue crossblue shield  and other \\nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \\npayment table 2 the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries \\n     since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women \\nincreased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \\nthe same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 233 \\nessentially the same as the 235 observed \\n     based on the nhds of the approximately 4111000 live births in 1991 an \\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page

628000 650 were primary \\ncesareans since 1986 approximately 600000 primary cesareans have been \\nperformed annually in 1986 85 of women who had a previous cesarean \\ndelivered vaginally compared with 242 in 1991 of all cesareans in 1991 \\n350 were associated with a previous cesarean 304 with dystocia ie \\nfailure of labor to progress 117 with breech presentation 92 with fetal \\ndistress and 137 with all other specified complications \\n     the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 28 days in \\ncomparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 45 days \\nand for a repeat cesarean 42 days  nearly twice the duration for vbac \\ndeliveries 22 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs 23 \\ndays in 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 32 days for \\nprimary cesareans 52 days for repeat cesareans 47 days and for vbac and \\nnonvbac vaginal deliveries 27 and 26 days respectively \\nreported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center \\nfor health statistics cdc \\neditorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from \\n1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rates \\nhave been stable since 1986 3 because there is little evidence that \\nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \\ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \\nchildbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the \\noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \\ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 148 \\n     postpartum complications  including urinary tract and wound infections \\n may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \\nthan for vaginal births 5 moreover the prolonged hospital stays for \\ncesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs for example in \\n1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and \\n4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \\n611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 if the cesarean \\nrate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 235 the number \\nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349000 617000 versus 966000 \\nresulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital \\ncharges \\n     despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 several factors may \\nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \\ndelivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women \\noffered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7 \\nof women who are offered a trial of labor 5070 could deliver vaginally 7 \\na level already achieved by many hospitals 8 trial of labor was routinely \\noffered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for which

vbac rate according to nhds data \\nwas 57 the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 based on all \\nwomen who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was \\nattempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the \\nvbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \\nrate \\n     one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \\napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \\ndelivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreview \\nprocess 10 other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \\ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \\nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of \\nphysician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \\nawareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns \\nwhich may be an important

 preventive measures that are also important for \\nshortterm travelers to such areas \\n     mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most \\nother areas with

after 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent primarily in the ldl \\nfraction which rose 39 percent  hdlcholesterol increased by 31 per cent \\nand ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little  plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent and subjects averaged an 8pound gain in \\nweight  according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays \\nhicnet medical newsletter

hdlcholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy  in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption  \\nin the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories  we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol  hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study dr connor explains\\n     low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol  hdl remains an important predictor to americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake \\n     dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csi \\naround 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs  such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat high in fiber  dr connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that americans adopt a mediterraneanstyle diet  the original \\nmediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products  we are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products  simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation \\n     the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development  dr connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given societys elite who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen  if the pattern of afluence increases the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society  who would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying for \\nunnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says\\n     the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent excessive diet  the present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago so a lot has been accomplished  we are changing rapidly

which though sometimes true is \\n    misleading  it is not often found effective particularly by itself\\n    primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug\\n    therapy  the most current theories of this condition attribute \\n    it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this\\n    distinction becomes important\\n2  i mentioned that the dsmiiir mentions impulses as a possible \\n\\tdiagnostic marker  however this might look like something\\n\\tpeople associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or\\n\\tunpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd  \\n\\tone of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual\\n\\tcan and does suppress some of their impulses although they\\n\\tare an unending source of anxiety  \\n\\tthe obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with \\n\\tocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to\\n\\ta superstitious nature than a dangerous nature

rise\\n\\nmaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1400 as part of new proposals announced by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt\\n\\nit would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007 ms hewitt told gmtvs sunday programme other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children the tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as desperate while the liberal democrats said it was misdirected\\n\\nms hewitt said we have already doubled the length of maternity pay it was 13 weeks when we were elected we have already taken it up to 26 weeks we are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next parliament she said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid we have made a firm commitment we will definitely extend the maternity pay from the six months where it now is to nine months thats the extra £1400 she said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partners maternity pay or leave period or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children the shadow secretary of state for the family theresa may said these plans were announced by gordon brown in his prebudget review in december and tony blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters\\n\\nshe said the conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the general election liberal democrat spokeswoman for women sandra gidley said while mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the liberal democrats feel this money is being misdirected she said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time\\n\\nms hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers not employers but david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce warned that many small firms could be crippled by the move while the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the governments statutory pay recruitment costs advertising costs retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be he said further details of the governments plans will be outlined on monday new mothers are currently entitled to 90 of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth followed by £10280 a week until the baby is six months old\\ncrucial decision on supercasinos\\n\\na decision on whether

say the issue of supercasinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility\\ncouncil tax rise reasonable\\n\\nwelsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of 6 says the assembly government\\n\\nfinance minister sue essex said it was a good deal for local government the £32bn settlement includes the full £74m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises in addition £134m will come from the business support grant  a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates she said where spending rises were kept to around 5 she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels the welsh local government association wlga had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington of torfaen said it was vital that rises were minimsed a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems said mr wellington it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase on monday a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds ms essex said i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels even for those people who have moved up a band\\n\\nthe settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 164 rise in capital expenditure support ms essex said this is a good deal for local government which will allow the wellmanaged councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level plaid cymrus local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing he said wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims  it is anger this will mean either a massive hike in council tax massive cuts in services provided by councils or both mike german leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding mr german said i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum but the random redistribution effect of rebandingwill create a great deal of difficulty conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception he added around a third of welsh households have been revalued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures\\nkilroy launches veritas party\\n\\nexbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert

kilroysilk\\n\\nmr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left\\n\\nmr kilroysilk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight\\n\\nmr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead\\n\\nthis is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further\\n\\nthank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the election\\n\\nit is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infighting\\n\\nukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilk\\n\\nif he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another\\n\\nso ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow\\n\\ninteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name\\n\\nevery opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come\\n\\nwell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here\\n\\nlets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurity\\n\\nveritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the tootwee label of veritas symbolises that\\nblair damaged by blunkett row\\n\\na majority of voters 68 believe the prime

electoral register may miss out local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over nonstatutory matters such as the transport referendum therefore residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote\\n\\nhowever there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of februarys voting deadline mr ballard said this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas are registered to vote in the ballot many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say everyone involved in this debate  both for and against  wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible and that means encouraging people to take part the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the councils proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it the outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council towards the end of february the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme

said when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment his great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds many of whose language he could barely understand genuinely to hear what they had to say and to

from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for\\n\\nmr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma the scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it he told bbc radio 4s world at one in the uk more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo he said and only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code the code of conduct is much more

retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter\\n\\nlabours mr livingstone who says he is standing by his remarks had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise he said to media representatives if you think they are racist i think you are wrong the mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs who arrived in london on tuesday i think it is important that the ioc international olympic committee members realise that when we get the gamesthey have a mayor who is not going to panic change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget he said\\n\\non tuesday the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly two motions were passed by the london assembly which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayors activities on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of examples of intrusion by journalists into his and his familys private life i dont suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history but when reporters say to me im only doing this because its my job thats the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard\\n\\nwe are responsible for our own choices in this life i always have been and so have reporters an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews demanding an investigation by the standards board of england it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said there must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years\\n\\ni have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i dont intend to now because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers on tape mr livingstone who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a german war criminal mr finegold replies no im jewish i wasnt a german war criminal im quite offended by that the mayor then says ah right well you might be but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard you are just doing it because you are paid to arent you\\npakistani women must not hide\\n\\nhiding women away in

visiting the pakistani community in manchester my wife is travelling around she is very religious but she is very moderate said general musharraf it comes after pakistans high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves\\n\\ngen musharraf told the bbc some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out  absolutely wrong the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe yes absolutely and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems so therefore we can never address it in its totality he said we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic longterm context\\n\\nit is the political disputes and we need to resolve them and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street on his first official visit to london he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon\\n\\nthe mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharrafs visit to

call signs and codes speaking in london on monday gen musharraf said alqaeda was on the run in pakistan\\n\\nbut standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the core of what creates terrorists what creates an extremist militant environment which then leads on to terrorism that is the resolution of political disputes\\n\\nmr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan the wider war on terror the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there said mr blair in respect of iraq we agreed that whatever the issues of the past the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a

name\\n\\nian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful he was part of a 19strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign\\n\\nmr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally\\n\\nunder the antiterrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations as far as im concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this he added\\n\\nthe attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers  nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac  a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio 4s today programme that more lawyers may go i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights\\n\\nhelena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law\\nmps murder sentence concern\\n\\nmurder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report\\n\\nthe influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse\\n\\nthe committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff  the minimum term they must serve  if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champions killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years  it would have been longer had he denied the charge\\n\\namandas uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing lastminute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty\\n\\nthe measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill\\n\\nas a result says the committee the government may need to relegislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolfs sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a 15year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police\\n\\nmr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial\\n\\nshadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences  such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news\\ntsunami debt deal to be announced\\n\\nchancellor gordon brown has said he hopes to announce

lessons  or social cohesion and democracy will suffer says the education watchdog\\n\\nindependent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief david bell for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of british society mr bell said muslim jewish and evangelical christian schools must be intolerant of intolerance diversity certainly must not mean segregated or separate he said mr bells speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship  with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more\\n\\nbadlytaught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell and in a speech to the hansard society he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy public service and shared values he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools  which he said included about 100 muslim 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools\\n\\nmr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion i worry that many young people are being educated in faithbased schools with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society said mr bell the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues but he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens equal under the law should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community be they women or people living in nontraditional relationships said mr bell\\nministers lose slopping out case\\n\\nthe scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmates compensation for being forced to slop out in prison\\n\\narmed robber robert napier 25 won £2450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint eczema when slopping out at barlinnie prison napier said that the practice where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets breached his human rights on thursday the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof\\n\\nthe executive faces more than 1000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates more than 310 actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland an executive spokesman said we will study this judgement in detail much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case for example slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated todays judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases napier a remand prisoner at the time raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the european convention on human rights in which he sought £5000 he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case\\n\\nexecutive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland however civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard napiers lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others mr kelly said there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by todays judgement scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish he said ministers were fully aware of the state of scotlands jails funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost\\nchancellor rallies labour voters\\n\\ngordon brown has issued a rallying cry telling supporters the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election\\n\\nthe chancellor said the vote  expected to fall on 5 may  will give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and conservative cuts speaking at labours spring conference in gateshead mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands he said tory plans to cut £35bn tax would cut deep into public service\\n\\nto a packed audience at gatesheads sage centre the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country he told activists laying into the conservatives record in government he said i give you this promise  with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10 inflation 15 interest rates £3bn in lost reserves 250000 repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed never again tory boom and bust\\n\\nthis will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by 2008 £60bn more turning to the economy the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power\\n\\nhe said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to the only party trusted with the economy it was now a party not just of employees but of employers and managers he said in the speech  which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly warm to mr brown  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years he also highlighted plans for 100 debt relief for the worlds poorest countries a national minimum wage for 16 and 17yearolds and the creation of a network of childrens centres and flexibility in maternity leave the prime minister is to take part

said\\n\\nministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear\\n\\nthe bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids\\n\\ntony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland it is important we dont end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said\\n\\non tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203 despite rebellion by 34 labour mps the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been\\n\\nlord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life the motive has got to be to end suffering he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said i dont think it is something to be embarrassed about these issues are not easy to deal with he went on bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague\\nantiterror plan faces first test\\n\\nplans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament\\n\\ntories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens the government is expected to win wednesdays vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords\\n\\nthe prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects\\n\\nthe two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the sayso of the home secretary rather than a judge tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four  for which tony blair recently apologised  as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and thats why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio 4s today programme\\n\\nmr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now  even for the 11 current terror detainees he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at londons belmarsh prison they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules  and which are due to expire on 14 march\\n\\nthe new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days  wednesday and next monday  to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently\\n\\nin a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence mr davis told today it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned\\n\\nhe questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice nobody should doubt that terrorists at

in positions of leadership not just president bush have a responsibility to rise to this challenge it is urgent that we do so mr blair also paid tribute to democrat john kerrys campaign saying he had

attention from the real issues it has been claimed\\n\\njack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnells comment was illadvised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotlands binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions\\n\\nthe onesentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and illadvised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\\n\\nmr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotlands fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was illadvised  but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland\\n\\nwe dont want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark\\n\\nthe scottish national partys holyrood leader nicola sturgeon

young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with  all for the sake of a simple soundbite\\nguantanamo four free in weeks\\n\\nall four britons held by the us

breach of international law and that the british government wanted no part of it and wanted guantanamo bay shut down they didnt do that they colluded with it moazzam beggs labour mp roger godsiff welcomed his release but said questions remained unanswered particularly about charges asked about possible damages mr begg and the other detainees could bring against the us mr godsiff said people

what those policies actually meant\\n\\nhe accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls he said with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue\\n\\nthe 25 memberstates are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy in favour of the qualified majority voting qmv system under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states britain is expected to retain an optin right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution if we dont work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours said mr oaten the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but its right that we dont do this in isolation\\nwatchdog probes email deletions\\n\\nthe information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete emails more than three months old\\n\\nrichard thomas totally condemned the deletion of emails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january government guidance said emails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose mr thomas said the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules\\n\\ntory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on email retention on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government emails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was too unlikely to have been a coincidence mr beith said but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the email regime could support the freedom of information regime\\n\\nmr thomas said the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of emails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor all emails are subject to the freedom of information laws but the important thing was the content of the email said mr thomas\\n\\nif in doubt retain that has been the longstanding principle of the civil service and public authorities its only when youve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned the freedom of information act will cover england wales and northern ireland from next year similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100000 public bodies subject to various exemptions its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner\\nconcerns at school diploma plan\\n\\nfinal appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for englands secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report\\n\\nthe governments response to the plan for a fourtier diploma to replace all existing 1419 qualifications is expected next week some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and alevels stay sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a halfhearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman\\n\\nhis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma  but only to replace existing vocational qualifications we must tackle headon the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise the qca said the potential stepchange in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener it is a sign of the qcas concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing  whatever spin is put on it\\n\\nthe chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and alevels should go one of the reasons why im so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that its good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said if we dont say this is a seachange in education we will miss a great opportunity universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy  decidedly not gcses it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score another dissenter is sir mike tomlinsons predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top alevel grade no matter how well the others have done\\nhoward rejects bnps claim\\n\\ntory leader michael howard has dismissed claims that his immigration policy was moving onto the turf of the british national party bnp\\n\\nbnp leader nick griffin told the independent he expected some bnp voters to switch to the tories over the issue but mr howard said he rejected the idea that the tories and bnp appealed to the same voting instincts asked if he would welcome bnp voters he told the bbc i dont want anybody to vote for these extremist parties he added on bbc radio 4s today programme if you want good community relations in this countrythen you have to have firm fair immigration controls\\n\\nthe tories have promised an upper limit on the number of people allowed into britain with the slogan its not racist to impose limits on immigration all parties are stepping up campaiging in the runup to the general election widely expected to be called for 5 may labour has unveiled its own points system for ensuring migrants who want to work in the uk have skills that are required but have rejected immigration quotas the liberal democrats have warned both parties against pandering to prejudice\\n\\nmr griffin told the independent the tories plans were a definite move onto our turf he said i quite freely accept that on a nationwide basis the tories will con enough people to make a significant hole in our vote asked whether he was comfortable with the perception that the conservatives and the bnp appeal to the same voting instincts mr howard told the bbc i reject that entirely he said he found bnps policies abhorrent but he said the uk had to take a different approach to immigration which he said was out of control the government doesnt want to limit it in any way we do theres a legitimate difference between us there which we can discuss in a calm rational and reasonable way he said he again rejected newspaper speculation that his own father entered britain illegally\\ncorrection agency plans dropped\\n\\nplans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped\\n\\nthe scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments the national correctional agency would have provided a onestop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending\\n\\nscotlands reoffending rate is high with more than 60 of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail this is leading to an everexpanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem ministers thought merging the prison service with the councilcontrolled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system\\n\\nshe will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the spss role and performance in reducing reoffending the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there communities who are paying the price for this reoffending  both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs  expect better it costs the taxpayer £35000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament\\ntutus guantanamo release call\\n\\narchbishop desmond tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at guantanamo bay and terror suspects detained

scaling up the relief effort particularly in aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the indian ocean at the moment he said weve also had raf aircraft flying in equipment which the un

make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing\\n\\nthat is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could

including cardiff bangor aberystwyth and wrexham gordon brown issued a defiant statement about the strike saying the action would not affect the governments determination to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare education transport and the fight against crime our decisions mean more police more teachers more doctors and more nurses he said we will provide help with information relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment the ukwide action hit jobcentres benefit agencies pensions offices and driving test centres the strike also affected the welsh assembly building in cardiff bay where only passholders were allowed in\\n\\npickets were in place across wales with protests around the country pcs union spokesman jeff evans said in wales the civil service is major employer there are more civil servants employed in wales proportionately than in any other part of the country our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country parts of objective one areas and welshspeaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts the chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police piers freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at companies house in cardiff he said the majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs i joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension as we thought and pay and its those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs people like pensioners need a facetoface service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they

revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen\\n\\nlord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence but he told mps the lord chancellor lord falconer was insisting he should have the final say in such cases lord huttons inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries\\n\\nthe government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolfs wishes lord woolf who is lord chief justice of england and wales was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committees inquiry into public inquiries he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so which judge it should be in written evidence to the committee lord woolf said i have so far failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue  i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation\\n\\njudges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue such as the intelligence on iraqs weapons of mass destruction he said he argued the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved in addition the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed the judiciary as a result of the appointment may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government he told the mps anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me\\n\\nlord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns but that situation could change with new legal reforms the issue had been overlooked when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement on appointing a judge it doesnt happen he said\\n\\nlord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence  a very narrow dispute in lord woolfs words she said as lord woolf also acknowledged it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries\\ntory expert denies defeatism\\n\\nthe conservatives campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael

who will unveil his plans on monday said economic migration helped the uk but needed proper policing the lib dems say they will look at his plans but tory liam fox said his party offered a clear choice on the issue the conservative party cochairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas\\n\\nthe home secretary said by 2008 he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken to ensure we can know everybody who is in the country speaking on bbc ones breakfast with frost he said economic migrants are of great value to this country but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a burden on society he said we will establish a system  which looks at the skills talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country\\n\\nthe home secretary whose fiveyear blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry the issue of who does come into this country and whether they are entitled to be in this country who does settle here how we have border controls is a perfectly

in detail my duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are mr clarkes comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath mr heath said the judgement contained unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nations security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made no contingency plans for the present circumstances\\n\\nthese detainees should be prosecuted and tried simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option shadow home secretary david davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of

came on charles clarkes first day as home secretary last thursday following david blunketts resignation in a statement on the same day mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year in the meantime we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of

the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects but not britons lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home offices powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human

death test case probe\\n\\nthe family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the governments refusal to order a full inquiry\\n\\nthe high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousas death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out their families will be appealing against the judgement\\n\\nthe families solicitor phil shiner described it as a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk fatheroftwo mr mousa 28 a hotel receptionist was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003 he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queens lancashire regiment the iraqi families lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights\\n\\nministry of defence lawyers argued the ukcontrolled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a ukrun prison but did not apply to the total territory of another state they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died his case came within the uks jurisdiction the other five iraqis did not die in custody so their cases had to fail they said\\n\\nand it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred has been timely open or effective the judges said after the ruling carla ferstman legal director of the human rights organisation redress said it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may 2003 both sides were granted permission to appeal\\n\\nprime minister tony blairs official spokesman said obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment i would point out however that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority i cant say anything further for obvious reasons the mod are considering whether to appeal but former british commander colonel bob stewart said  anyone at the top of the military will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say if theres a case to answer lets have it out because we dont want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it he said the ministry of defence does everything in its power

they were acting honestly and instinctively new guidelines say\\n\\nthe law also protects those who use something to hand as a weapon the leaflet published by police and prosecutors aims to combat confusion about current legislation which lets people use reasonable force the guidance relating to england and wales follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law doing what you honestly and instinctively believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully the guidance said\\n\\nand the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service cps and association of chief police officers acpo\\n\\nas a general rule the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt the more force can be used lawfully in selfdefence it said adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of excessive and gratuitous force the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private members bill in parliament\\n\\nthe government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary home secretary charles clarke said i believe in that old adage an englishmans home is his castle thats exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that an informal trawl of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years five of whom were convicted they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire before beating him up throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire\\n\\na cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder in one of britains highest profile cases norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16yearold burglar fred barras in 1999 the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003 the guidance published on tuesday said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were determined they would be dealt with as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible it said\\nwoolf murder sentence rethink\\n\\nplans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down\\n\\nthere was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council  led by lord woolf  published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to onesixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances  for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and cooperation he said\\n\\nbut director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the lawabiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said\\n\\nin a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said\\nprobe launched on ken nazi jibe\\n\\nan investigation by the standards board is under way following allegations that ken livingstone has

 said if the claims were true whitehall was acting entirely against the spirit of the new act both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close

for a debate although it has never happened before the 2001 election plans for a debate between mr blair william hague and charles kennedy collapsed in 1997 a debate between mr blair and john major

spring poll\\n\\nweve called for the state pension to be increased from £7960 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £10545 thats what were calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if weve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line weve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty\\n\\nweve drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once weve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well its our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for granted\\n\\npensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has

expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so theres a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory  on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything\\n\\nit will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face its exactly what

trophy hunting we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and wouldbe mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it\\n\\ni think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban\\n\\nthe issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade its become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions misselling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumers terms  that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice\\n\\nfirstly we have our website it features our campaigns and changes every day secondly through our 700000 members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a preelection conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians\\n\\ni think we will be successful its very much the

there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business\\n\\nwe will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably its one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press whatever we do the

spending by tackling waste\\n\\nthe money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election lets be realistic  the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc 1s breakfast with frost programme however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday\\n\\nthe bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said the £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both so part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the governments black hole reducing the borrowing the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today\\n\\nmr howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business troubleshooter david james home office spending could be cut by £16bn according to the final instalment of his yearlong review savings of £153m at

conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they cant make these savings and cant pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is £35bn of cuts hitting frontline public services hard liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howards claims of £35bn worth of savings this cant be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the

election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test\\n\\nand mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election\\n\\nthe gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow  as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson  that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election\\n\\nthere was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats\\n\\nlabour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name\\nbest person for top legal job\\n\\nthe best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily a lawyer or mp the courts minister has told mps\\n\\nunder reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions the lord chancellorno more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor said courts minister christopher leslie the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday mr leslie said the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons under the reforms the law lords will also be replaced as the uks highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers\\n\\nin december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor he said what matters most iswhether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges\\n\\nshadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing a champion of the independence of the judiciary the government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces mr grieve said convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords the government would have great difficulty in getting the bill through parliament former cabinet minister douglas hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the bill was largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellors role and office cannot be frozen in aspic\\nhoward dismisses tory tax fears\\n\\nmichael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest\\n\\nhe defended the package saying it was a plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further the tories on monday highlighted £35bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services labour and the liberal democrats say the partys sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the partys mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted\\n\\ntory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts interviewed on bbc radio 2s jeremy vine show mr howard said it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts\\n\\non the other side there are people who say we wont be able to achieve these tax cuts i think we have got it about right mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes he added i would like to be able to do more and over time i am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget i have got to be responsible about this\\n\\nthe latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election  widely expected in may  gathered pace the liberal

labours manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax\\n\\nthe premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its postelection budget mr blair derided tory claims they could cut £35bn in wasteful spending saying the party had got its sums wrong the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the preelection period mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes mr blair replied i think they are wrong for this very simple reason that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced\\n\\nthey also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing

are a ludicrous improbability\\n\\nthe prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut £35bn in wasteful spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britains hardwon economic stability  the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades  and the key investment in public services\\n\\ni believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as its possible to imagine he said its a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government mr blair added they the conservatives have learned nothing by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed\\n\\nmr blair went on to list his governments achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party so now we have a choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back and i say we have to fight in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labours spending on health and education everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with a tory government he concluded\\n\\ngordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011 which the tories deny mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the longterm decisions necessary to meet them\\n\\nmr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the partys proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans he still cannot accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people  schools hospitals and police  and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election  which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans\\nlib dems bold election policy\\n\\ncharles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election\\n\\nwith the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two with his partys previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over £100000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax that last policy will also see about 3 of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less\\n\\nlabour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed\\n\\ninevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s but unlike the old torylabour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts\\n\\nsimilarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howards proposals for quotas once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his partys election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll he repeated his pledge not to do postelection deals with either party after the election mr kennedy went on to suggest the reelection of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence  in tony blairs government that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before\\nboothroyd calls for lords

in 1999 labour removed all but 92 of the lords 750 hereditary peers that was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution the lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next labour manifesto\\n\\ni think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons lord falconer told bbc1s breakfast with frost how it interacts with the commons is a very very important issue we need to address the issue in the manifesto but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary\\n\\nlady boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of

has said\\n\\nfears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning\\n\\nthere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 2002 and 2003 with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash  something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be £10000  a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003\\n\\neven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more smallscale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200 it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters\\n\\nthe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll  as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find

increasing basic state pensions for over75s putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks he said the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50 tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the polluter who pays\\n\\nthe lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises mr kennedy said that contract with the people  that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely  can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown the obvious unfairness of our current tax system  especially the council tax and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue  it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the governments performance\\n\\nconservative cochairman liam fox said liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments the reality is the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy and the only people who would face tough choices would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year  and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more\\nelection deal faltered over heath role\\n\\nthe tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for cooperation\\n\\ndocuments released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leaders own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent threeday week labour emerged with the most seats  but its 301 mps were 17 short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority\\n\\nsir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number 10 providing the 14 liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the governments programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservativeliberal pact\\n\\nhours later sir edwards hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpes colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath\\n\\nthey feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said  no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve  it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become twofold mr thorpes colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edwards resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell  a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out\\n\\nfour hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime ministers colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labourled coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government\\nconservative mp defects to labour\\n\\na conservative mp and former minister has defected to labour\\n\\nrobert jackson 58 mp for wantage in oxfordshire said he was disillusioned with the partys leadership and its dangerous views on europe prime minister tony blair declared himself delighted saying mr jackson would be warmly welcomed by labour mps mr jackson who has clashed with his leaders over tuition fees and europe in the past served as higher education minister between 1987 and 1990 in a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote it is in the countrys best interest that tony blair rather than michael howard should form the next government while saying he admired mr blairs courageous leadership of the country he bitterly criticised the conservatives stance on europe the conservative partys hostility to europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of britains treaty obligations he wrote\\n\\nmr blair said mr jackson was a decent fairminded and dedicated public servant who will be warmly welcome by labour mps and members as he rightly says the conservatives have learned nothing from their two election defeats and are if anything drifting further rightwards he added a spokesman for michael howard said mr jacksons views on policy issues were very different from those of the party leadership he believes students should pay tuition fees that tony blair should not be criticised over his handling of the iraq war and that more powers should be given to europe the spokesman said he added that it was not surprising mr jackson had chosen to leave the conservatives mr jackson is due to stand down at the next election he is the third conservative mp to defect to labour since 1997\\nblunkett sorry over murder plan\\n\\ndavid blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws\\n\\nthe home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences the home office has already said the review will begin next year\\n\\non wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps\\n\\nin its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence\\n\\nbut the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146  among them 21 judges  believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease\\n\\na key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife\\nparties warned over grey vote\\n\\npolitical parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election says age concern\\n\\na survey for the charity suggests 69 of over55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17 of 18 to 24 year olds charity boss gordon lishman said if a decisive blow was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out a total of 3028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension\\n\\nhe also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to support us all in an ageing society older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives mr lishman said political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote in the survey carried out by icm research 14 of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections among the over65s 70 said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election compared with 39 of people under 55 age concern says the over55s are united around key areas of policy they want the government to focus on for 57 pensions and the nhs were key issues while the economy was important for a third and tax was a crucial area for 25\\n\\nthe report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts the pensioners voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blairs cool britannia he said labours continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing strengthen company pensions and encourage savings a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously he highlighted the partys promises to raise the basic state pension provide free longterm care for the elderly and replace council tax seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system\\nblair moves to woo jewish voters\\n\\ntony blair has pledged to never ever ever attack tory leader michael howard over his jewish beliefs\\n\\nthe prime minister told the jewish chronicle if you look at what i do i attack michael howard politically mr blair also distanced himself from recent labour campaign posters featuring mr howard which critics claimed were antisemitic these were not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the jewish community mr blair insisted\\n\\none poster depicted mr howard and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin who is also jewish as flying pigs another pictured the tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain which critics said echoed the jewish money lender shylock in shakespeares merchant of venice\\n\\nothers compared the image to the character fagin in charles dickens oliver twist labour has since taken the designs of its website saying members had preferred other designs during his interview with the jewish chronicle mr blair said ive been a very strong supporter of the jewish community and israel and will always be so pressed on whether he would draw attention to mr howards jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract muslim support he replied the idea that i would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous its untrue if you look what i do i attack michael howard politically i would never ever ever attack him on that basis\\n\\nmr blair also defended his partys attitude towards the jewish community pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the holocaust memorial day he added that labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism\\n\\nneither the conservatives nor the liberal democrats wished to comment on mr blairs words the prime minister was speaking as londons labour mayor ken livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a jewish reporter from the citys evening standard newspaper mr blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter oliver finegold to a concentration camp guard mr livingstone should have withdrawn the comment immediately once he realised the journalist was jewish said mr blair im sure that is what in truth he wants to do well he should do it mr livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper he conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked\\nparties plans for council tax\\n\\nanger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003 when the average english bill rose 129\\n\\npensioners protests spread  some marched others simply refused to pay the increase some such as 83yearold elizabeth winkfield said they would rather go to jail the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was fundamentally flawed and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change\\n\\nlabour says it wants to retain the propertybased tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills with a £100 lump sum for the over70s and last year the government capped some local councils budgets to keep demands down deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be radical reform the party says this years increases will be the lowest in a decade a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation such as reformed business rates although no decisions have been made an independent inquiry into its findings the lyons review is due to report back at the end of 2005\\n\\nthe tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners who they say have been hardest hit by yearonyear increases in council tax they say they can save £4bn on government waste of which £13bn could be used to cut pensioners bills by an average of £340 it would not be means tested say the tories because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill up to a maximum of £500 the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes  currently graded according to their value in 1991  because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band\\n\\nthe liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa norway and switzerland the rate would be set locally but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £300m they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain because it puts a ceiling on what the richest pay the party says it would aim for a £5000 taxfree personal allowance or a £7000 allowance for the over65s after that income would be taxed up to £100000 the lib dems say their plan is fairer more efficient has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability\\nmps tout lords replacement plan\\n\\na group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change\\n\\nthe crossparty group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70 of members would be elected mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats the group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords tony blair has argued there needs to be consensus on reforms there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labours manifesto\\n\\nbut the allparty group including tories ken clarke and sir george young labours robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler is confident its plan would win support from a large majority and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largelyelected second chamber their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament and its members would be known as mscps\\n\\nthere would be 385 mscps including 270 elected members 87 appointed members and 16 bishops they would serve for between 12 and 14 years mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout he added over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament\\n\\nthe group believes pressure is growing for change and the governments current position is unsustainable it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a largely democratic second chamber in their manifestos mr clarke said the issue went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system and mr tyler said the prime ministers view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed the problem i think in the prime ministers mind is there doesnt appear to be a consensus that includes him he said we are providing a consensus the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny said coordinator peter facey in lieu of any other such clear proposals the government must permit that to happen\\nschools to take part in mock poll\\n\\nrecord numbers of schools across the uk are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government\\n\\nsome 600 schools

place with donations totalling £4610849 while the liberal democrats received just over £1m the majority of labours donations came from affiliated trade unions there were also large sums from individuals lord drayson whose company powderject won multimillion pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 september terror attacks gave £500000 to the party just days before christmas\\n\\nthis followed an earlier donation of the same amount earlier in 2004 he was made a lord by tony blair last year other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist sir christopher ondaatje who gave the party a sum of £500000 and refrigerator magnate william haughey obe who gave £330000 the totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003 as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign the largest donation to the conservatives was a bequest from ruth beardmore of nearly £400000 the

andor damages against you we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party he said mr hulmecross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe rather than sticking to an independent stance but the claim was denied by

ramming through parliament the controversial new antiterror measures without proper debate he didnt say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless\\n\\nwhat this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government and that is more important to them than national security liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the governments immediate instinct was authoritarian\\n\\nas is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard  he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point apart from all that it was electioneering as usual the very first question to the prime minister from derby norths bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools later birminghams sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now the prime minister almost blushed this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away  an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 april for an election on 5 may is where the big money is in the commons and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment\\ntory expert denies defeat warning\\n\\nthe conservatives campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael howard the party

john howard win four elections mr howard appointed mr crosby as his elections chief last october mr crosbys statement said the conservative party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax

on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election  widely tipped for 5 may  would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election he said theres no limit to the ambitions we have as a party but we have got to be responsible we have got to be credible we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task\\n\\nmr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to topup fees and the conservatives were not asking the critical questions and he said people were highly sceptical about labour and conservative promises on tax but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door if you look at the four previous parliamentary byelections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government thats going to be the story i think of this coming general election\\ntories attack burglar uturns\\n\\ntory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing uturns over rules on using force against burglars\\n\\nthe government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying it is not householders who should be frightened its the burglars home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law\\n\\nmetropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law he told mps if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves on thursday mr howard told bbc radio 4s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again he said weve had three policy positions in three months and two uturns its not surprising gordon brown told him theres nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe\\n\\nmr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16yearold burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke he said the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it  that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said tory mp patrick mercers private members bill

raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this he told bbc radio 4s the world at one but he said there was a recognition that a good settlement for local government was important to health education and other government departments ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without unreasonable council tax increases he added mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election\\n\\nthis is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face mr raynsford also plans to make

intact into the 20000 feet deep tonga trench in\\n    the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to

the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was\\n    organized by dr michael prather nasagoddard institute for space\\n    studies  the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia\\n    nasagiss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasagoddard space\\n    flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and\\n    environmental research inc  the effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere\\n    the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine\\n       industrial sources    300000000 kilogramsyear\\n\\t  natural sources     75000000 kilogramsyear\\n\\t  shuttle sources\\t  725000 kilogramsyear\\n    the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly thus the launches would add less than 025 to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources\\n    the effect on ozone is minimal  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 00065 this is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares\\n    the influence of humanmade chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and\\n    titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible  the launch\\n    schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time\\n    theoretical results of this study have been published in the space\\n

rogers commission report for example\\n    what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin\\n    teams medicalforensic report\\n    the astronauts were killed when the moreorless intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200mph and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team\\n    examined them they were sent off to be buried\\n    you cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit\\n    because it cant get there it is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks\\n    furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between earths surface and low orbit taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized highorbit\\n    spacecraft\\n    yet another concise answer by henry spencer\\n    there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face

70a13\\n    with the sun 27 degrees from the west\\n    science writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is\\n    artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an\\n

frequently\\n    the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks\\n    kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov\\n    the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc gc 2102\\n    says\\n\\tduring the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an iloaded vrel sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative qalpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity improved sband look angles and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target\\n\\tin second stage\\n    this really is a good answer but its couched in nasa jargon ill try\\n    to interpret\\n    1\\twe wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling\\n    2\\tthen we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the\\n\\trelative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle a negative qalpha\\tthis causes a little bit of\\n\\tdownward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z\\n\\tdirection and this force alleviates structural loading\\n\\twe have to be careful about those wings  theyre about the\\n\\tmost delicate part of the vehicle\\n    3\\tthe new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didnt roll performance gain\\n    4\\tthe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\\n    5\\tthe new attitude improves the ability for groundbased radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good lineofsight signal with the sband radio\\n\\tantennae on the orbiter improved sband look angles\\n    6\\tthe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a\\n\\thelpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine\\n    7\\tthe new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east\\n\\tusually  this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit  remember\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction\\n\\tthe shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit\\n    this all begs the question why isnt the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with  why does the shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude  the answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the apollo days  the shuttle straddles two flame trenches  one\\n    for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main\\n    engine exhaust  you can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam  watch for the difference between the top\\n    orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the saturn vs  a side note the\\n    saturn vs also had a roll program  dont ask me why  im a shuttle\\n    guy\\n    i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics\\the added that the roll\\n    maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw\\n    the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack qalpha within a tight tolerance  the yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination  the total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a gradlevelmath\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one fourelement\\n    array\\n    nasa select is

spacecraft to venus failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962 the guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the\\n    onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the\\n    range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted\\n    from the expression rdotbar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation\\n    mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december\\n    of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a\\n    very hot 800 degrees fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees f world\\n    with a cloudcovered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978\\n    mariner 3 launched on november 5 1964 was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space unable to collect the suns energy for power from its solar\\n    panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4\\n    mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 did reach mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first closeup images of the martian surface 22 in all as it\\n    flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense\\n    mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967 it reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2 plus the information\\n    that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of earths or the equivalent of being 3300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean\\n    mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by mariner 4 four years earlier however they failed to take away\\n    the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic\\n    measurements of mariner 4\\n    mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed\\n    mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 became the first craft to\\n    orbit mars in 1971 it returned information on the red planet that no\\n    other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian\\n    surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos\\n    mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974 the probe\\n    did return the first closeup images of the venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    earth days mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed\\n    mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet\\n    pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters\\n    pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective  to photograph\\n    the moon closeup  but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between earth and the moon including new\\n    data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer 1 was launched on\\n    october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6\\n    pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first\\n    us spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959 pioneer 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to\\n    362 million kilometers in 1960 a record until mariner 2 pioneer 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would\\n    have been number 10 suffered a launch failure in 1969\\n    pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973 pioneer\\n    11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study saturn in 1979 both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever\\n    to do so\\n    pioneer venus 1 1978 also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer\\n    12 burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992 pvo made\\n    the first radar studies of the planets surface via probe pioneer venus\\n    2 also known as pioneer 13 sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in december of 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 675 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed\\n    ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they\\n    were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed\\n    ranger 3 launched on january 26 1962 was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit\\n    ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt\\n    ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 had the same purpose as ranger 3 but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside\\n    the first us probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data\\n    ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit\\n    ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions they were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the moon ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate ranger 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first\\n    us lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965\\n    lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo\\n    missions of 19691972 the probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside\\n    all five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were\\n    essentially successful in their missions they were the first us\\n    probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions\\n    the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the\\n    soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968\\n    only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions the rest became the\\n    first us probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis apollo 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor 7\\n    the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the tycho crater region in 1968\\n    viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on\\n    a titan 3ecentaur d1 rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june\\n    19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse\\n    planitia on july 20 1976 it soon began its programmed search for\\n    martian microorganisms there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was\\n    pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image\\n    the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7 1980 when it ran\\n    out of attitudecontrol propellant the lander was switched into a\\n    weatherreporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders communication was never regained again despite the\\n    engineers efforts through may of 1983\\n    an interesting side note viking 1s lander has been designated the\\n    thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington\\n    dc is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition\\n    viking 2 was launched on september 9 1975 and arrived in martian orbit\\n    on august 7 1976 the lander touched down on september 3 1976 in\\n    utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording\\n    one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitudecontrol gas leaks in\\n    1978 which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut\\n    down on april 12 1980\\n    the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025\\n    voyager 1 was launched september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march\\n    5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980 voyager 2 was launched\\n    august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7\\n    1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and\\n    by neptune on august 8 1989 voyager 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    onceevery189years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have headed towards pluto\\n    but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up\\n    between the two probes our knowledge of the 4 giant planets their\\n    satellites and their rings has become immense voyager 12 discovered\\n    that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and\\n    aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major\\n    surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere\\n    when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance a 33year great white spotband cycle\\n    is known titans atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was\\n    startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance\\n    the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids\\n    kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain\\n    voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts\\n    continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on\\n    ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered\\n    in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather\\n    including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring two other rings and 6 other satellites were\\n    discovered neptunes magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers whats liquid at 38k\\n    the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their\\n    ontarget journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond pluto

 which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on\\n    january 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earths the closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s jstutc9h on january 8 1992 the\\n    geocentric distance was 88997 km this is the first planetswingby for\\n    a japanese spacecraft\\n    during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail\\n    passages will be

flyby on march 19 where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr\\n    the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it hagoromos rocket

step back and consider the functionality we want\\n1 microgravityvacuum process research\\n2 life sciences research adaptation to space\\n3 spacecraft maintenence \\nthe old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far was to\\ncentralize functionality  these projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it and ssf has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication  over 50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization  meanwhile military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development the \\nconstellation  \\nfirstly different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function\\nthus we have the gpsnavstar constellation in 12hour orbits\\ncomsats in clarke and molniya orbits etc  secondly the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed\\nssfs 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization\\n1 we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now\\ncomet and mir for longduration flights shuttlespacelab for\\nshortduration flights  the best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive incremental improvement installation of us facilities \\non mir shuttlemir linkup and transition from shuttlespacelab\\nto a much less expensive sstospacehabcomet or sstosifcomet\\nwe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments eg the highradiation van allen belt \\nor gasplasma gradients in comet tails  the comet system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond leo\\n2 we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity\\nbut also in lunar and martian gravities and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof leo  this is a very longterm lowpriority project since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude  furthermore using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation\\nand the sample size  so i propose labratsat a constellation\\ntetherbolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin supervanallenbelt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on earthmoon earthmars\\nearthasteroid etc trips  the miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated realtime from earth thru a vr\\ninterface  after several orbital missions have been flown\\nfollowons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before billions\\nare spent on astronauts\\n3 by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nclarke orbit  i propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills  once in place robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs\\ninject fuel etc  once the fleet is working it can be\\nspun off to commercial companys who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards\\nby applying the successful constellation strategy and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost  for a fraction of ssfs pricetag\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study\\nlifes adaptation to a much large  more representative variety \\nof space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and if needed in specialpurpose\\norbits\\nnb we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality  \\nmars network and artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used\\nto fuel planetwide roverballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return  the

comes from fission of actinides in subcritical\\nassemblies  folks have talked about spallation reactors since the\\n1950s  pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research\\ntools  accelerator design has been improving particularly with\\nsuperconducting accelerating cavities which helps feasibility  los\\nalamos has expertise in high current accelerators lampf so i\\nbelieve they know what they are talking about\\ni will believe that this process comes even close to approaching\\ntechnological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the\\ntrash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of\\nseparating things first and having a different run for each\\nactinide when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull\\nrelatively clean material out the other  once the costs\\ntechnological risks etc are taken into account i still class this\\none with the idea of throwing waste into the sun  sure its possible\\nand the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable\\napproach \\nand i still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get with\\nsomething like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would\\nreally recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power\\nwith and without the energy recovery  are we talking ounces pounds\\nor tons grams kilograms or metric tons for you si fans of\\nmaterial and are we talking days weeks months or years days\\nweeks months or years for you si fans  hmmm still using a\\nnondecimated time scale i see  \\nthe real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being\\nbuilt is that there isnt any reason to do so  natural uranium is\\nstill too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks\\ntechnically reasonable\\ninsisting on

graphed line encloses envelopes the\\narea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft\\ndoesnt fall out of the sky  hence pushing the envelope becomes\\noperating at or beyond the edge of the flight or operational\\nenvelope \\nnote that the envelope isnt precisely known until someone actually\\nflies the airplane in those regions  up to that point all there are\\nare the theoretical predictions  hence one of the things test pilots\\ndo for a living is push the envelope to find out how close the\\ncorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is  in\\nessence pushing back the edges of the theoretical envelope to where\\nthe airplane actually starts to fail to fly  note too that this is\\ndone is a quite calculated and careful way flight tests are generally\\ncarefully coreographed and just what is going to be pushed and how\\nfar is precisely planned despite occasional deviations from plans\\nsuch as the early first flight of the f16

\\nidentified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic \\nemissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement \\n     geoff perry of the kettering group in england

1993\\ntranslated in fbissov93060 p27\\n     moscow 31 march  another artificial earth satellite cosmos2238 was \\nlaunched on 30 march from the baykonur cosmodrome \\n     the satellite carries scientific apparatus for continuing space research \\nthe satellite has been placed in an orbit with the following parameters \\ninitial period of revolution928 minutes apogee443 km perigee413 km \\norbital inclination65 degrees \\n     besides scientific apparatus the satellite carries a radio system for the \\nprecise measurement of orbital elements and a radiotelemetry system for

of the big 6 martin\\nmariatta boeing mcdonell douglas general dynamics lockheed rockwell\\ngetting together and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market\\nprice pints are for building reusable launch vehicles and spending say\\n3million to do that  recognizing that most of the military requirements\\nfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere say has the shuttle \\never really used that 1200mi crossrange capability  you get the idea figure\\nout how many how often where to etc\\nthen taking this data and forming a sematech type company bad example i\\nknow but at least its an example  to develop between 3 and 5 craft\\ndesigns  then to take all of those designs and figure out exactly what\\nthe technologies are and demonstrate those technologies in order to \\neliminate designs that cant be built today  and lets say that this\\nportion again funded by the gov cost about 20 million\\nand from here all of these companies went their separate ways with the\\nintention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall\\nstreet and saying i want to build this vehicle and here are the numbers\\nthat show 20 roi fund me\\nnow many of you think that this is a joke but i have it on good authority that\\njust this project is shaping up in the background it seems that the aerospace\\ncompanies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things\\nends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled nasp nls\\nals dcy etc  they need to work more in the japaneese and european\\nspirit of initial cooperation  they have also learned that design requirements\\nthat are phony ie some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be\\nends up getting chopped up in congress because it is not a real requirement\\nany feedback\\n\\t\\t\\tjohn\\nthe following are my thoughts on a meeting that i hugh kelso and bob lilly\\nhad with an aide of sen patty murrays  we were there to discuss ssto and\\ncommercial space  this is how it went\\nafter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto\\ni called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty\\nmurray washington state  i started asking for an hour and when i heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to 12 an hour\\nlater in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes\\nwe got the standard bozo treatment  that is we were called back by an aide\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material\\nwell i got allocated 12 hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening\\nwe covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific  \\nmost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer  there was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that\\nwe brought up\\nbut with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as noncorporate\\naligned ie not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space\\nso we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nleo  solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that\\nwe hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism\\npaper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog\\nover la  we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is \\nmore pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to \\nunderstanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis  we hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other\\nfields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed\\nwe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle  we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal\\ncommunicators tellecommunications new services etc  jobs provided\\nin those sectors\\njobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc\\nwe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs\\nwe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do  and he asked questions on this point\\nwe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan\\nand most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to leo\\nin the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data \\npurchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it\\nhe asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it\\nand contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there\\nthe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didnt know\\nthe answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers\\nthen finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself  he\\nsaid that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days\\nall in all we felt like we did a pretty good job\\n\\t\\t\\tjohn\\non tue 6

the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter\\n    continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and\\n    targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturns atmosphere\\n    rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of saturns\\n    satellites and characterize titans atmosphere and surface\\n    one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere\\n    the cassini mission is

and\\ntechnology policy outlined to the membersdesignate of\\nthe advisory committee on the redesign of the space\\nstation on april 3 three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station\\na low option of 5 billion a midrange option of 7\\nbillion and a high option of 9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment operations utilization shuttle\\nintegration facilities research operations support\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds\\nover the next 5 years 4 billion is reserved within\\nthe nasa budget for the presidents new technology\\ninvestment as a result station options above 7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the nasa budget  for example a space\\nstation option of 9 billion would require 2 billion\\nin offsets from the nasa budget over the next 5 years\\ngibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee generally the\\nmembersdesignate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted they also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the station redesign team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider\\ngibbons also announced that the united states and its\\ninternational partners  the europeans japanese and\\ncanadians  have decided after consultation to give\\nfull consideration to use of russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process\\nto that end the russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an asneeded consulting\\nbasis so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the\\npossible use of mir and other russian capabilities and\\nsystems the us and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the russian participants\\nin assessing russian systems and technology the\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities careful\\nintegration of russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal\\ngibbons reiterated that president clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents\\nhowever he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational

standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of 2100 and an early exit\\n\\njames mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injuryplagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 339 was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005 pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders teammates

birmingham is the next of those targets gebrselassies current record stands at eight minutes 0469 seconds and bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the national indoor arena the

their former coach as to why they missed the tests were unacceptable it added that kenteris and thanou had been provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases they face twoyear bans if

nothing to hide the iaafs decision means nothing he said well be presenting all our arguments to segas  were innocent\\nathens memories soar above lows\\n\\nwell its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens\\n\\nobviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember  or forget  for athletics \\n\\n \\n\\none of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the 800m\\n\\nwinning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldnt i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldnt you do the 800m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story \\n\\n \\n\\nthe victory for the british mens 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them  jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis  knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake \\n\\n \\n\\nhicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale\\n\\nhe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5000m titles as soon as he had added the 5000m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good \\n\\n \\n\\nwhat happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10000m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day\\n\\nthings like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people  including me \\n\\n \\n\\npurely as a race paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nipandtuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out \\n\\n \\n\\nkelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level\\n\\nthe only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond \\n\\n \\n\\ni tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special \\n\\n \\n\\nto be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on\\n\\nhaving said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it\\ncollins banned in landmark case\\n\\nsprinter michelle collins has received an eightyear ban for doping offences after a hearing at the north american court of arbitration for sport cas\\n\\namericas former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use collins ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal the 33yearold was found guilty of using performanceenhancing drugs the us antidoping agency usada decided to press charges against collins in the summer the sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the cas has upheld usadas findings the usada has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that collins took epo the testosteroneepitestosterone cream and thg said a cas statement collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time so far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the balco doping scandal world record holder tim montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the usada his hearing before the csa has been rescheduled for june next year\\n\\ndrug enforcement chiefs in the us have vowed to crack down on cheats usada chief executive officer terry madden said the action taken against collins was further proof of that the cas panels decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of usadas ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of us athletes that compete drugfree said madden the usada has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into balco rather than test results the san franciscobased balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges the trial is expected to open next march\\njones doping probe begins\\n\\nan investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee\\n\\nioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performanceenhancing drugs before the sydney olympics but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge\\n\\nany decision on the medals would be taken by the iocs executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world antidoping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now we will find a way to deal with that pound said in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared victor contes allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements\\njohnson accuses british sprinters\\n\\nformer olympic champion michael johnson has accused britains top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition\\n\\nat the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world 200m and 400m record holder told five live athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride however linford christie countered its easy to criticise when you havent gone through the system here johnson was involved in a verbal spat with britains darren campbell earlier this year the american had cast doubt on campbells claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic 100m and 200m finals\\n\\nand the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed athletes here have to compete more outside the uk their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter speaking at an elite coaches conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards you cant fix everything with money he admitted you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding those who arent funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging so when they get to the top they are more appreciative\\nradcliffe proves doubters wrong\\n\\nthis wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of paulas career but as a test of character it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in\\n\\na win in the new york marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paulas last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future even if shed lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours 23 minutes wasnt one of paulas best times it wasnt far off the record on a difficult course\\n\\ni was speaking to paula in the leadup to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a nowin situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldnt she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10000m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens  the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions  werent at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paulas mind if she wasnt confident she wouldnt have run after all if youre the best in the world at an event youll always have expectations of winning\\n\\nnow paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year have a wellearned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism\\njones medals must go if guilty\\n\\nworld antidoping agency wada chief dick pound says marion jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances\\n\\nvictor conte of balco laboratories claims the american sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance if she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years said pound asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken pound said that is not an issue at all however under international olympic committee ioc rules athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event jones who won five medals at the 2000 olympics denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over contes allegations balco laboratories is the firm at the centre of a widereaching investigation into doping in the us pound continued if she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people\\niaaf launches fight against drugs\\n\\nthe iaaf  athletics world governing body  has met antidoping officials coaches and athletes to coordinate the fight against drugs in sport\\n\\ntwo task forces have been set up to examine doping and nutrition issues it was also agreed that a programme to demystify the issue to athletes the public and the media was a priority nothing was decided to change things  it was more to have a forum of the stakeholders allowing them to express themselves said an iaaf spokesman getting everyone together gave us a lot of food for thought about 60 people attended sundays meeting in monaco including iaaf chief lamine diack and namibian athlete frankie fredericks now a member of the athletes commission i am very happy to see you all members of the athletics family respond positively to the iaaf call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping

tackles marathon tasks\\n\\npaula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday\\n\\nback under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10000m bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race \\n\\nthe ability to run a gruelling 262 miles relies largely upon an athletes belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish\\n\\nthe question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in highprofile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30yearold must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment \\n\\nfor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york  win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a hasbeen and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues\\n\\nathletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone elses agenda radcliffes best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30yearold is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york she just thought well they cant think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport shes just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it \\n\\nradcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a ticklist of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you cant change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race \\n\\nthe course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves\\n\\nradcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon its suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner but that is only for longterm health and fitness when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just isnt going to be there in new york thats been taken out of the equation \\n\\n\\n\\nradcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards\\n\\none of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says i think this will probably make paula i think it will drive her on and shell come out of it a better athlete\\ngatlin and hayes win owen awards\\n\\namerican olympic stars justin gatlin and joanna hayes have been named the winners of the 2004 jesse owens awards usa track  fields usatf

marathon\\n\\nthe briton running for the first time since dropping out of the olympic marathon and 10000m held off kenyan susan chepkemei in a thrilling finish the pair were locked together for the last few miles before radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours 23 minutes and 10 seconds its a good way to end the year she said im ready for a good rest now radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago but the world recordholder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace just chepkemei and radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles the kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off radcliffe but the briton managed to hang in both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest finish in the races history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in athens\\n\\n\\ncollins named uk athletics chief\\n\\nuk

competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers and britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in italy this year collins will not have daytoday coaching contact with the athletes but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching setup in order to secure medals at the beijing olympics in 2008 the appointment of a new performance director

the same role with the dutch olympic committee while connors application was rejected after an arduous interview process foster however declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made the

general public\\n\\nradcliffes comments come at a time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use being caught in possession of a performanceenhancing drugs should carry a penalty she added\\n\\nthe current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route often when an athlete puts in a good performance they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise having been on the receiving end of accusations like this i can testify as to how much this hurts\\nkenteris denies faking road crash\\n\\ngreek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked a

lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performanceenhancing drugs\\n\\nthe sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking 25m £13m in the suit conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000 her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs contes statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs victor conte is a man facing a 42count federal indictment while marion jones is one of americas most decorated female athletes mr contes statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination\\n\\nmr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sports ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to contes allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of contes television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march\\ndibaba breaks 5000m world record\\n\\nethiopias

hamstring injury during training\\n\\nthe double olympic champion said i am very disappointed that i have been forced to withdraw i can hardly walk at the moment and i wont be able to do any running for two or three weeks although ill be keeping fit as best i can holmes will have now have intensive treatment in south africa\\n\\nthe 34yearold made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1000m title at the birmingham grand prix 10 days ago after that race and more progress in training holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the european indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend on saturday night i pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night said holmes i was going really really well when i felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew i saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but its frustrating missing madrid when i knew i was in great shape holmes has now been advised by her coach margot jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer helen clitheroe now goes to madrid as the only british competitor in the womens 1500m while there will be no representative in the 800m\\nkluft impressed by sotherton form\\n\\nolympic heptathlon champion carolina kluft was full of admiration for britains kelly sotherton as the

third behind the swede in athens and kluft said i knew about her shes a great girl she looked very good early in the season and was competing really well kluft showed impressive earlyseason form on tuesday in stockholms ge galan meeting winning the sprint hurdles the long jump and the 400m sotherton has also displayed promise with a new high jump personal best in sheffield at the combined norwich union european trials and aaa championships and a second place in the long jump behind jade johnson\\nwhat now for kelly holmes\\n\\nlast april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics\\n\\nit just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34yearold has repeatedly chosen to tick the dont know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekends european indoor championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of a hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well its a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if youre very talented\\n\\nholmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable  that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career emptyhanded but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what i dont know at 34 holmes will also be aware that time is running out us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson a fivetime olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britains double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the daytoday grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesnt like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the 34yearold revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title\\n\\nholmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation  the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated you dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its a fantastic feeling i think deep down kelly wants to run i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain\\n\\nathletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the newlook kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again thats just kelly explains cram shes always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now its headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again noone is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision\\ngardener battles to narrow win\\n\\njason gardener fought all the way to the line to narrowly claim the mens 60m title at the norwich union indoor trials and aaas

i stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through i still feel theres more life in me and i believe i can go faster gardeners performance in sheffield could have been affected by the news which he heard before his semifinal that his european record had been broken frenchman ronald pognon who will be a real threat at the european championships set a new time of 645 onehundreth of a second faster than gardeners previous mark favourite\\n\\ndelivered a powerful performance to take the womens 60m title in 727 seconds youll see me in madrid and i feel there is a lot more to come along said

tomlinson\\n\\n now based at loughborough sprinted past front runner catherine murphy in the final 100m to steal the womens 400m title the 21yearold ran a personal best of 5345 seconds to win her

enough to qualify for madrid but ovens had already opted out of the championships the mens race was won by\\n\\n who had to fight off a closing pack to claim the title in 34587\\neuropean medal chances improve\\n\\nwhat have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects\\n\\nit was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around\\n\\nthe best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the 60m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens 60m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid\\n\\nphillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 1730m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency  and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far\\n\\nshe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker\\n\\njanine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them\\nisinbayeva claims new world best\\n\\npole vaulter yelena isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 489 metres in lievin on saturday\\n\\nit was the russians 12th world record of

year in disappointing style falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite her olympic buildup was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she

he said its worth a punt isnt it shes gone back to training if shes confident she will pick one distance the programme does not permit both if holmes does take her place in the gb side she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance under championship rules she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in madrid on 4 march jones added she was pleased with her run in birmingham at last weekends grand prix i am inclined to think she will compete it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form and he admitted holmes presence

meet\\n\\nyelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham\\n\\nand hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record\\n\\napparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three 800m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens 60m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish\\n\\nit would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon  who has run 645 seconds  will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet\\n\\nsomething else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national 400m race in a new personal best of 5298 seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3000m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens 1500m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly\\ntomlinson stays focused on europe\\n\\nlong jumper chris tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the european indoor championships\\n\\nthe

same as exercising outdoors one of the iocs technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning but when youre gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday after the week id had i was a bit concerned i wouldnt be able to complete it but i coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly

hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury according to reports\\n\\nhansen the commonwealth and european champion has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june 2004 it was hoped she would be able to return this summer but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal her coach aston moore told the times were not looking at any sooner than 2006 not as a triple jumper moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner but there is no shortterm prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months but that has been solved and we can push ahead now he said the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete  then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to toplevel competition though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march when she will be 34 its been a frustrating time for her but it has not fazed her determination he

speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty\\n\\nwe were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with he said so how can you as a greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes he added the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou but sevastis said it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed\\niaaf will contest greek decision\\n\\nthe international association of athletics

erroneous the statement continued both athletes cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas the decision in both cases will be final and binding\\n\\nsegas said the iaaf appeal was expected and understandable now we are going to await the final result which we cannot prejudge said segas chairman vassilis sevastis kenteris who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games however the independent tribunal overturned those bans clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify antidoping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics\\n\\nkenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaafs decision as not unexpected but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly the iaafs timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions said ioannidis the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements testimonies the closing speeches of defence counsel and nine audio tapes\\n\\nwe have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summers olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august the pair then spent four days in a hospital

from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august\\n\\nthe pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committees demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens the charge cannot be substantiated he said in no way was he kenteris informed to appear for a doping test the same goes for thanou kenteriss lawyer gregory ioannidis said the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career\\n\\nhe has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one it shows he has no case to answer mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest our doping review board will now consider the

conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said i stand by everything i said jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000 her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performanceenhancing drugs contes statements the suit added were false and malicious after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout she has never ever used performanceenhancing drugs victor conte is a man facing a 42count federal indictment while marion jones is one of americas most decorated female athletes mr contes statements have been wildly contradictory mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination\\n\\nmr conte is simply not credible we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed the sports ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to contes allegations but contacted the us antidoping agency communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of contes television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body usa track and field to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added the us antidoping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its antidoping war and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us antidoping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test meanwhile conte who has been charged along

authority has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident thanou said i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse i cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time i always said we needed a pr person an

matteroffact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the 50k walk there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford man but i was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully id be able to race it took over 10 hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so im fierce lucky not be paralysed id fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake jamie didnt finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident\\n\\nfor the first nine hours i had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat but once i got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinkingok ive got a different set of circumstances now within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamies back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home  something he is now very relieved about the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae that would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race again they were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery but when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back\\n\\nhe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 january walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and its very effective needles get put right close up to my spine a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and im fairly incapacitated today as a result jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years i was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy basically theres a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing\\n\\njamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twicedaily physio sessions and poolwork all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006 its all about trying to get mobility in my back lying down for three and a half months didnt really help with the strength theres a lot of work involved in my recovery im doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work im also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles im fairly full on with everything i do id hope to be training regularly by march but training is just part of the process of getting back at the moment every time i go and do a big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up its a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts hopefully after four or five months my back

broadening my mind said lewisfrancis the sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the athens games last year i was 91kg now i am 869kg  hopefully my times will come down he said this has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks it is just discipline and being more focused about what i am doing\\n\\ni am still keeping up my weights work and i can see the improvement in my running despite playing his part in britains successful 4x100m relay team lewisfrancis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 olympics that was heartbreaking but i had made it to the semifinal and for me on a personal level that was an achievement i just have to be patient and build up for the next olympics that is my goal

ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes freekick marcus bent missed evertons best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet\\n\\nrooneys return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kickoff and rooneys every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19yearold everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goalline but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes rising to meet ronaldos cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith united dominated without creating too many clearcut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before halftime mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldos low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly and martyn came to evertons rescue three minutes later when rooneys big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage scholes freekick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily evertons problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal rooneys desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injurytime when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker\\n\\n manchester

ferguson hinted he may be back early he said there is a chance he could be involved at everton but well just have to see how he comes through training the 28yearold has been training in holland and ferguson said ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and i am very satisfied with it even without van nistelrooy united made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 20 derby victory at manchester city on sunday but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international who is the clubs top scorer this season with 12 goals he has not played since aggravating the injury in the 30 win against west brom on 27 november ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooys absence meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games including the first goal against city on sunday\\nmoyes uturn on beattie dismissal\\n\\neverton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas\\n\\nthe scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 10 saying gallas overreacted but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again he said i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick rerun of the incident\\n\\nthe club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturdays match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character  james has never even been suspended before in his career  his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his teammates james did issue a formal apology to myself his teammates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily speaking immediately after the game moyes said i dont think it was a sendingoff i have been a centrehalf in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that\\n\\nnot in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them what has happened to big strong centrehalves i thought it was a push initially and i still dont think it was a sendingoff an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him i can tell you it wasnt an intentional headbutt we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if youre going to stay in my way ill go straight over

to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and thats something thats needed the home international series was done away with in 1984 with the traditional scotlandengland fixture continuing until 1989 that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season he added i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20000 fans turned up to watch england were criticised for the 00 draw against holland  the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies you have to put a performance on in friendly games if you dont they can be demotivating it can be a dangerous road to go down if players dont apply themselves in the manner they should so i would support the return of the home internationals  the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule\\nthe arizona attorney general ag mark brnovich has filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against google alleging that the company used “deceptive” practices to track the location of users even after they turned off location tracking\\n\\nbrnovich shared information about the lawsuit on his twitter account he accused google of using “deceptive and unfair practices to obtain users’ location data” this data is exploited for advertising which accounts for more than 80 per cent of google’s revenue\\n\\ngoogle collects detailed information about its users including their physical locations to target users for advertising often this is done without the users’ consent or knowledge\\n\\nbrnovich wrote on twitter “google collects detailed information about its users including their physical locations to target users for advertising often this is done without the users’ consent or knowledge”\\n\\nhe told the washington post that google has been trying to find “misleading ways” to obtain information from users who try to opt out of data collection he added that google may be the “most innovative company in the world” but it is not above the law\\n\\nhis office’s investigation of google was initiated after reading a 2018 associated press report which detailed how google users are “lulled into a false sense of security” by privacy options including the option to disable location history the investigation found that many google services on android devices and also iphones store location data even if the user selects privacy settings which purport to prevent google from doing so\\n\\nthe findings were confirmed by computer scientists at princeton university\\n\\nthe lawsuit specifically alleges that google maintained location tracking for certain features including weather and search

put a stop to google’s deceptive collection of user data obtain monetary relief and require google to disgorge gross receipts arising from its arizona activities” brnovich added in another tweet\\n\\nhe has asked for the courts to force google to pay back any profits it may have earned by exploiting data fraudulently acquired from arizonans the washington post posits that arizona’s state fraud laws may also allow for a 10000 fine per violation\\n\\nbrnovich’s action comes on the heels of a lawsuit from new mexico ag hector balderas who sued google for allegedly collecting children’s data without required parental consent  a possible violation of the children’s online privacy protection act coppa 1998 according to the lawsuit google harvested data including youtube activity voice recordings physical locations browser activity and contacts from free chromebooks provided to schools through the g suite for education platform and then used this data for personalised advertising up until april 2014 balderas had previously sued google and other companies for violating coppa in 2018\\n\\nalthough google has made some compromises in recent years such as making it easier to delete location data it remains the target of lawmakers and activists for the aggressive dataharvesting practices on which its business model relies google and other us tech giants are facing a number of major regulatory and legal challenges around the world mostly relating to antitrust and privacy\\n\\ngoogle said in a statement to media “the ag and the contingency fee lawyers

websites\\n\\nthe autolink feature comes with googles latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazoncom if it finds a books isbn number on the site it also links to googles map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is a licence plate google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links but some users are concerned that googles dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon\\n\\nautolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage  even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission\\n\\nif a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a books unique isbn number would link directly to amazons website it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazoncom whether they like it or not websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizenbased media said the tool was a bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time\\n\\nthe new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses but as an end user i would want to know  can i choose to use this service how much is google being paid can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service\\nmobile multimedia slow to catch on\\n\\nthere is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular\\n\\nconsumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26 increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004 according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold globally between july and september 2004 a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so\\n\\nin fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing figures gathered by continental research shows that 36 of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from 7 in 2003 this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 75 million getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets\\n\\nalso he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to according to continental research 29 of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation only 11 regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them said mr jain they ask themselves if im streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said theres a lot of user apprehension about that\\n\\nthere are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users\\n\\nnoone wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wappush to get multimedia to their customers but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content as a result 40 of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses cellticks broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting

had increased by 150 in the last year about 70 were using filesharing program bittorrent the firm said its now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr said ben coppin from envisional a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100000 people globally said the report and an estimated 20000 of those were from within the uk\\n\\nfans of many popular us tv programmes like 24 usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk but in some cases said the report people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet explained mr coppin\\n\\ntwo clicks and your favourite programme is downloading in effect the internet is now a global video recorder exact figures are difficult to pin down but it is thought that about 80000 to 100000 people in the uk download tv programmes some may just want the odd episode others are downloading regularly many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like tv programmes this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes the industry has coined the term timeshifting to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders tivotype boxes which automatically record programmes like sky have also contributed to the trend there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer\\n\\nwithin half an hour recorded episodes can be uploaded  or posted  onto filesharing networks or other download sites because they tend to be shorter then fulllength films they can be processed  digitised  quickly more people with highspeed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly\\n\\naccording to jupiter research 40 of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows the ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player imp last year which was based on a peertopeer distribution model it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year the bbc already allows radio fans

sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time i hope this day will focus people curt hopkins director of the committee told the bbc news website\\n\\nthe group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take including writing to local iranian embassies the committee has deemed tuesday free mojtaba and arash day as part of its first campaign it is calling on the blogsphere  the name for the worldwide community of bloggers  to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other cyberdissidents if you have a blog the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except free mojtaba and arash day said mr hopkins that would mean you could see that phrase 71 million times that alone will shine some light on the situation if you dont have one find one dedicated to that  it takes about 30 seconds technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12000 are added daily a blog is created every 58 seconds according to a us research thinktank\\n\\nthe committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director she has since started the international bloggers bill of rights a global petition to protect bloggers at work

speech\\n\\nthe committee although only a month old aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future and will operate as a nonforprofit organisation blogging is in this weird no mans land people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view said mr hopkins some think of themselves as pundits kind of like journalists and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold\\n\\nit is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal and often anonymous blogs have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in\\n\\nthis is a big messy argument explained mr hopkins he added it is just such a new way of doing business there will be clamp downs but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which said mr hopkins is part of the whole messy conversation if you havent already got bloggers in your company you will have them tomorrow  and if you dont have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one mr hopkins said that the blogsphere  which is doubling every five months  was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog

just good for the environment it has social benefits too\\n\\nresearch has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites\\n\\nthe report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year only 25 get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or reuse the slowly growing mass of unrecycled discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets the equivalent of 9000 tonnes of waste estimates james goodman report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future its quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around said mr goodman\\n\\nmany of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world said mr goodman far better he said to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life weve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back said mr goodman but theres a strong social argument too older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model the forum for the future report took an indepth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular its an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network said mr goodman and theres a real desire for people to get mobile phones but the relatively low wages in romania which is one of the poorest countries in europe mean few people can afford a shiny new phone the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one he said reconditioned handsets have boosted takeup of mobiles as the report revealed that almost onethird of romanian prepay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets the reused handsets tend to be about onethird of the price of a new handset georgeta minciu a romanian parttime cleaner said normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages i am a single parent  keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me this is the only way i can afford to have a phone she said mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britains mobile mountain made it overseas but he added those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset if its more than a few years old

ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years will unveil the chip at a technology conference the chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip sony has said the cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game sony told an audience at the e3 exhibition in los angeles last year\\n\\ncell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers and everything in between said kevin krewell the editor in chief of microprocessor report the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch details of the chip will be released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco some details have already emerged however when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second\\n\\nthe chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006 in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony said last year current

light\\n\\nscientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade\\n\\nweve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intels photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it\\n\\ntelecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses its a technical validation that it can work he said\\nchina net cafe culture crackdown\\n\\nchinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n\\naccording to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n\\nthe official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n\\nnet cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world\\nsecurity scares spark browser fix\\n\\nmicrosoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser\\n\\nthe revamp has been prompted by microsofts growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of techsavvy criminals test versions of the new program called ie 7 are due to be released by the summer\\n\\nthe announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco although details were scant mr gates said ie7 would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information\\n\\nin a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6 microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes  some of which were found in the ie browser microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft antispyware program an ownbrand antivirus program is due to follow by the end of 2005 the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a uturn because before now microsoft said it had no need to update the browser typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows codenamed longhorn which is due to appear in 2006 the current version of internet explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004 estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely according to market statistics gathered by websidestory firefoxs market share is now about 5 of all users however other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15 some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90 but this is down from a peak of almost 96 in mid2004\\ngoogle and apple release contact

storage power on systems maintained by sun socalled grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity\\n\\nthe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said suns chief operating officer jonathan schwartz why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching suns quarterly network computing event in california the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries\\n\\nsome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5000 processors each sun said mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each\\n\\nalthough it only took a few seconds the experiment cost 12 £630 because it had used up 12 hours worth of computing power the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity ondemand service is cheaper than that offered by sun\\nlasers help bridge network gaps\\n\\nan indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country\\n\\ntata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers offices and its own core network the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations\\n\\nin this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task said mr r sridharan vice president of networks at tata heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult he said in some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs this has led chennaibased tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tatas core network and the premises of customers the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses\\n\\nthe laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 125gbps 2000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 12mbps the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate its particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and its hardly ever foggy he said in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said mr sridharan once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is a few hours he said by contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than 1000 speed is very important because of the pace of competition said mr sridharan\\ngame firm holds cast auditions\\n\\nvideo game firm bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members

for a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image the company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in west edmonton alberta on friday and saturday bringing along a piece of photo identification\\n\\nthere are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical bioware game said shauna perry biowares audio and external resources producer those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people people with interesting faces she added not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games people chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3d the 3d model will look exactly like the person  its really quite incredible how detailed they are said ms perry she said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game we cannot give people any control over how the images are used but their face could be used in multiple games  so they could be the hero in one

undergo a massive increase say experts\\n\\nantispam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real email messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent\\n\\nbefore now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous email relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the nets email sending infrastructure david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers they are adding to their armoury he said the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean email meltdown but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature if something like this mean the end of email then email would have stopped twothree years ago said mr hogan while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too mr hogan said 90 of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses for instance said mr hogan filtering out email messages that contain a web link can stop about 75 of spam\\nwarning over tsunami aid website\\n\\nnet users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims\\n\\nthe site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster\\n\\nthe link to the website is contained in a spam email that is currently circulating the messages subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts the web address of the fake site is decukorg which could be close enough to the official wwwdecorguk address to confuse some people keen to donate patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down she said the spam emails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web\\n\\ndec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation bt and decs hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said\\n\\nms sanders said sending out spam email to solicit donations was not decs style and that it would never canvass support in this way she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed none of the email addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid one email sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud emails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile other scam emails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information in a monthly report antivirus firm sophos said that two email messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january another tsunamirelated

whether it is google or other flavors of collaboration software there are others that are pushing the boundaries of what it is to collaborateopen source leaders slam patents\\n\\nthe war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents\\n\\nin a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future linux is a freelyavailable alternative to microsofts windows it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available other companies are expected to follow suit\\n\\nthere are between 150000 and 300000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they cant afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future if totally pushed to the wall  because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce softwareof course theyre going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have coexisted for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added\\nmicrosoft seeking spyware trojan\\n\\nmicrosoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firms antispyware software\\n\\nthe spyware tool was only released by

fears\\n\\nfake bank emails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say ebusiness experts\\n\\ntrust in online security is falling as a result almost 70 of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people the survey of more than 1000 people reported that 43 were not willing to hand over personal information online it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging ecommerce and ebanking are being taken seriously  by banks in particular\\n\\ni dont think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves if we do that they will indemnify us he said many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individuals identity several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget last year a street survey found that more than 70 of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate\\n\\non average people have to remember four different passwords some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer in a separate survey by rsa 80 said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard\\n\\nactivcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a onetime passcode generation service users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds many companies use a tokenbased method already for employees to access networks securely already activcards method is more complex it is currently trailing its onetime passcode generation technology with uk banks steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online\\n\\nthe end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction the clever bit happens back at the banks secure servers the code is validated by the banks systems matching the information they expect with the customers unique key each individual gets a key which is unique to them it is a 2048bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they cant prove who they are according to mr ash in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said\\nmobile networks seek turbo boost\\n\\nthirdgeneration mobile 3g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services\\n\\nthat was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at 3gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second  up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a highspeed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second kbps on standard 3g networks\\n\\nhighspeed downlink packet access hsdpa  sometimes called super 3g  will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by ukbased research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canadabased wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers\\n\\nwhile hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in widearea networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma 3g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 29mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised evdo\\n\\nus operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying evdo technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprints vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of 3bn in multiyear contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around 1bn on evdo technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0305 megabits a second and peak download rates of 24mbps mmo2 the ukbased operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access hsdpa standard using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of 36mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network and will eventually support speeds of up to 144mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson\\n\\nsiemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10 siemens  in collaboration with the fraunhofer germansino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology  has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dialup phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 05 megabits a second  must faster than 3g this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they arent those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multipleantennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as 2012 though siemens did not rule out an earlier date\\nglobal digital divide narrowing\\n\\nthe digital divide between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast according to a world bank report\\n\\nthe world bank

users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government\\n\\nthe service it safe will issue warnings about damaging viruses software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves the service will be free and those who sign up can get email or text alerts the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year based on previous experience of virus outbreaks there is a clear need for easytounderstand and simple independent advice for nontechnically minded people who use computers either at home or at work said home office minister hazel blears the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people\\n\\nfulltime staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items safe said roger cumming director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre niscc\\n\\nthe niscc which is running the service also stressed that those signing up would still need to use antivirus software firewalls and software updates to stay secure warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat this might include downloading an update from an antivirus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets\\n\\ngovernment statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer it was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004 the

from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001 hp the worlds biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change\\n\\nbut the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1700 in running costs over an 18month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uks office of

of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel\\n\\nthe second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on\\n\\nwhile the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away\\napple ipod

the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis

scammers a trade body has warned\\n\\nthe internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language\\n\\nregistering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers they are used so people can more easily navigate the web socalled ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian a look just like an english a but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake this is more than just a theory a fake paypalcom has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer\\n\\nit is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added there are solutions for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the worlds browsers another solution to introduce idndisabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees a rush to introduce idndisabled browsers into the marketplace is an overlyzealous step that will harm public confidence in idns  a technology that is desperately needed in the nonenglish speaking world the

required\\n\\noften this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision but that dance is growing more intimate as hitech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration and vice versa uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative the idea says bt is to shape a 21st century model which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology said frank stone head of the bts business sector programmes he looks after several centres of excellence which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries\\n\\nto mark the initiatives launch a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer they have both been created using the telcos technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program using a 3d graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming baftawinning artists langlands  bell have created a virtual storybased 3d model of brussels coudenberg cellars\\n\\nthey have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace an historical seat of european power the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century the river was integral to the citys survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared said the artists we hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the river senne in their previous works they used the quake game

been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners it was also used in 2003 in encounter an urbanbased pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical onthestreet action because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself\\n\\nas more tools for selfexpression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology the orange expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation\\n\\ntechnology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too the art world is fantastically rich said mr stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them between 1997 and 2002 the creative industry brought £21 billion to london alone it is an industry that is growing by 6 a year too the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to mr stone this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online he said it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem with broadband penetration reaching 100 in the uk businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies what we are trying to do is have outsidein thinking we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy said mr stone\\ncheaper chip for mobiles\\n\\na mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one

more texas is keen to cash in on the third generation 3g of mobile technology which offers highspeed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for highend mobiles\\n\\ncompetition to get people using 3g mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uks operators have now launched third generation networks a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of 3g handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10 of all phones sold many consumers are still to be convinced though a further recent survey said that only 4 of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3g phones many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard\\n\\nbut there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks earlier in january ntt

unveiled the finished version of its homegrown search engine\\n\\nthe now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003 the revamped engine indexes more pages than before can give direct answers to factual questions and features tools to help people create detailed queries microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries\\n\\ngoogle still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query keep up with news or search for images but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals such as yahoo and microsoft and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information  be it for a particular web page recipe book gadget news story image or anything else microsoft is keen to make its homegrown search engine a significant rival to google to generate its corpus of data microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days  more often than rivals the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer\\n\\nfor its direct answer feature microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions facts calculations conversions and solutions to equations tony macklin director of product at ask jeeves pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003 the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search so in many ways microsoft is following the market he said tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites countries regions or languages microsoft is also using socalled graphic equalisers that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more uptodate or more popular the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system the test or beta version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed\\nmoving mobile improves golf swing\\n\\na mobile phone that

resigned after only a year in his post\\n\\namit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the 911 attacks the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers viruses and other netbased threats reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation\\n\\nmr yoran took up his post in september 2003 and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running the organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about 80m £4454m the division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make us networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace\\n\\nin the last 12 months mr yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur the warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network the next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers mr yorans division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals despite this success mr yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week reportedly only giving one days notice to bosses at the department of homeland security amit yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year and we appreciate his efforts in starting the departments cybersecurity program said a department of homeland security spokeswoman some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against netbased threats in the wider homeland organisation an attempt by us politicians to pass a law to promote mr yoran and raise the profile of his departments work is now mired

services with size and battery life said jupiter a separate study by gartner has also said realtime tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until 2007 technical issues and standards must be resolved first said the report batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others bringing music download services based on the success of computerbased download services will put more demands on battery life\\n\\nfifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading after the success of apples itunes napster and other net music download services\\n\\nwith phones getting smarter and more powerful there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move in the us services like tivo to go let people transfer prerecorded tv content onto their phones but the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait currently tvlike services where clips are downloaded are offered by several european operators like italys tim and 3 mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report\\n\\nvarious standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally in europe trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day the service uses 3gp technology one of the standards for mobile tv but at the end of 2004 the european telecommunications institute etsi formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld dvbh as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring realtime broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed handsets also need to be able to work with the dvbh standard tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner digital video recorders like europes sky box and videoondemand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch as a result people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control more powerful smartphones like the xda ii nokia 6600 sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200 offering web access text and multimedia messaging email calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common a

scheme in the huaral valley 80 kilometres north of the capital lima aims to offer the 6000strong community uptodate information on agricultural market prices and trends the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancayhuaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions more than 13000 rural inhabitants as well as 18000 students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure\\n\\nthe 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september\\n\\nthe nongovernment organisation cepes peruvian centre for social studies led the 200000 project also backed by local institutions the education and agriculture ministries and european development organisations the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system said carlos saldarriaga technical coordinator at cepes farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network selfsustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes\\n\\none of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system with its flagship huaralorg website there farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancayhuaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems water is the main element that unites them all it is a precious element in perus coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world\\n\\ncepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the projects success throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project they feel it belongs to them said mr saldarriaga the community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm we have had an excellent response mainly from young people but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives so far the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers organisations in peru this is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places underlined mr saldarriaga\\n\\nthe cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo a 50family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site there it was necessary to build a minihydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights it was already dark when the technicians realised they didnt have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs recalls carlos saldarriaga the logical answer was we dont sell any so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing now with the wireless network cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated\\nmicrosoft releases patches\\n\\nmicrosoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs\\n\\nin its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched the number of holes considered critical is more than usual they affect windows programs including internet explorer ie media player and instant messaging four other important fixes were also released these were considered to be less critical however if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data\\n\\none of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through png files microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month the most important ones are those which are classed as critical its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsofts plans to make its own security programs\\nbe careful how you code\\n\\na new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson\\n\\nif it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eus ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas\\n\\nin the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to reenter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on oneclick online purchase it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it\\n\\nwe are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computerimplemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid1980s they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then represented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germanys main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned\\n\\nthe draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow\\n\\nmore directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone elses patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately i have never to my shame managed to read lord byrons childe harolds pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are usbased and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or crosslicense with other patent holders\\n\\neven this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnulinux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europes computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law\\n\\nbill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital\\nask jeeves joins web log market\\n\\nask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs\\n\\nthe bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed\\n\\nbloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication rss that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in 2003 in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it\\n\\nthe universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with asks my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders\\ndigital guru floats sub100 pc\\n\\nnicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mits media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than 100 £53\\n\\nhe told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries he said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel\\n\\nthe second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on\\n\\nwhile the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in 25 laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away\\nlooks and music to drive mobiles\\n\\nmobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner\\n\\nmore than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slowdown in replacement sales\\n\\nall the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones\\n\\nbut there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who dont really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms\\n\\nmore likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added this was not a womens thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of selfexpression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi\\n\\npeople are after something that is nicelooking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for fulltrack music downloads was worth just 20 million £105 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 18 billion £94 million by 2009 according to jupiter research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w800 which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorolas standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life\\nyahoo celebrates a decade online\\n\\nyahoo one of the nets most iconic companies is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week\\n\\nthe web portal has undergone

project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get uptodate information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the nongovernmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called eslates the eslates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld eslates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc\\n\\nthe system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project its very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but its also a oneway connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult\\n\\nthe project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linuxbased system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the worlds largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the eslates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the eslates says the projects ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting  as they need it most\\ntough rules for ringtone sellers\\n\\nfirms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks\\n\\nthe rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones\\n\\nin the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone\\n\\nif you are not on the operators portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because its a problem of how people discover your services he said to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004 websites such as grumbletextcouk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn people did not know they were being offered a subscription service we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added\\n\\nthe swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uks phone firms everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox\\n\\nits all about transparency he said consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it the consumer has a right to be protected he said christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if thats done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said we do not have to say why we can just cut them off under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn\\ncreator of first apple mac dies\\n\\njef raskin head of the team behind the first macintosh computer has died\\n\\nmr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskins belief that good design should make computers easy to use\\n\\nmr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31 initially to lead the companys publications department however in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use\\n\\nthe result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common textbased interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh the gui was developed by xerox parc and used in its star machine but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldnt be here if it werent for him said andy hertzfeld an early macintosh team member although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released in 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with apples mercurial boss steve jobs in 1982 mr raskin left apple entirely the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskins favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company after leaving apple mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers he was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted san franciscos chamber opera society mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california\\nfriends fear with lost mobiles\\n\\npeople are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that

has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs\\n\\nin its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched the number of holes considered critical is more than usual they affect windows programs including internet explorer ie media player and instant messaging four other important fixes were also released these were considered to be less critical however if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data\\n\\none of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through png files microsoft

lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hitech products\\n\\nat the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hitech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005 but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology the consumer electronics association cea has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than 12573 billion nearly £68 billion\\n\\nebays initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them the online auction house thinks that its alreadyestablished community of loyal users could be influential we really became aware of the ewaste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good ebays david stern told the bbc news website\\n\\nwe saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year yet only 15 are actually recycled this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards 10 to 28yearolds for returning unused phones this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile\\n\\none group of students collected 1000 mobiles for recycling in just three months mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free\\n\\nthere is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intels allen wilson told the bbc news website there is still lowlevel awareness right now but it is on the rise  the highest level of awareness is in europe a european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances elements like chromium lead and cadmium  common in consumer electronics goods  will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006\\n\\nbut it is not just about recycling either the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players\\n\\nalthough there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget on 1 january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about 35 more efficient the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board most are made in china about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hitech devices but also bundle with it a hitech efficient power supply the epas andrew fanara said initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes said the epa\\nevil twin fear for wireless net\\n\\npeople using wireless highspeed net wifi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points\\n\\nthe latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted wifi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability london leads the global wifi hotspots league with more than 1000 the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200000 by 2008 according to analysts users need to be wary of using their wifi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university\\n\\nusers can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wifi device has its security measures activated he added bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wifi secure naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bts wireless broadband\\n\\nbut wifi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dialup he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark\\n\\nin the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin cybercriminals dont have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency\\n\\nalthough wifi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use highspeed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a companys computer system public wifi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use but many home and company wifi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hijacked by anyone with the correct equipment bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museums dana centre in london on thursday\\nnew consoles promise big problems\\n\\nmaking games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told\\n\\nsony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may these socalled next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higherquality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a prerecorded video slot during microsofts keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film  believed to be battle angel alita the games visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsofts xbox 2 is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005 games typically take at least 18 months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today\\n\\naccording to robert walsh head of brisbanebased game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between 1025m to make with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if youre a startup i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for 10m however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games\\n\\none developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the bestselling the sims games the founder of californias maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoebasized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve\\n\\neventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i dont want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins  i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright id like to offer an alternative to that\\n\\nnew development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference\\n\\noxfordbased natural motion launched endorphin v20 which enables artists to direct a 3d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester startup genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photorealistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an inbuilt supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to 2000 new heads an hour\\n\\none area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices\\n\\nthe game developers conference included a special twoday summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdcs mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fastgrowing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world its predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter general manager at ea mobile ea mobile is a division of electronic arts the biggest games publisher until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones the last time you checked ea wasnt in this business mr batter admitted but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game created by ea mobiles 30person

programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change\\n\\nthe shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code\\n\\nthe growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package\\n\\nyou cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in email message attachments its about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cashrich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the 29a virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common in many ways the least likely way to do it is email because most of us have got antivirus and firewalls now he said few of the malicious programs written by hitech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works\\n\\nas the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network\\n\\nmany will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover socalled spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine\\ntvs future down the phone line\\n\\ninternet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now\\n\\nbut any early attempts to do it  the uks

is the future of television and it sits neatly with its vision of the connected entertainment experience telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time ed graczyk director of marketing for microsoft iptv told the bbc news website the challenge has been the broadband network and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution compression technology was not efficient enough the net was not good enough a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality\\n\\nlast year he said was all about deal making and partnering up shaping the iptv ecosystem this year those deals will start to play out and more services will come online 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies  over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america and other parts of asia it will expand he added what telcos really want to do is to send the tripleplay of video voice and data down one single line be it cable or dsl digital subscriber line some are talking about quadruple play too with mobile services added into the mix it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators according to technology analysts tdg research there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years\\n\\nkey to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data whenever a viewer wants it is that it uses the same technology as the internet it means there is not just a oneway relationship between the viewer and the broadcaster this allows for more dvdlike interactivity limitless storage and broadcast space bespoke channel playlists and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewers fingertips it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller niche or localised audiences sending films to bollywood fans for instance as well as individual devices\\n\\noperators could also send highdefinition programmes straight to the viewer bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver perhaps most compelling  yet some might say insignificant  is instantaneous channel flicking currently there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite cable or freeview with iptv the speed is 15 milliseconds that gets rounds of applause according to mr graczyk microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future  but that is several years away said mr graczyk as with music tv has moved to digital formats the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv to the mobile to the gaming console and so on the company intends its microsofts iptv edition software an endtoend management and delivery platform to let telcos to do exactly that seamlessly it has netted seven major telcos as customers representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date said mr graczyk\\n\\niptv is about more than telcos though there are several webbased offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the nets power jeremy allaire chief of brightcove told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a channel\\n\\nit is not just niches but about exploiting content not usually viewed he said we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content and who often see unencumbered distribution for them to do it through cable and so on is priceprohibitive he said this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators  history channel archives for instance what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field there are a lot of other middleware players providing similar management services as microsoft like myrio and ccor but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful\\nsoftware watching while you work\\n\\nsoftware that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrongdoing has been unveiled\\n\\nworries about cybercrime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees the developers behind the system claim it is a breakthrough in the way data is monitored and stored but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software\\n\\nthe system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hitech crime unit nhtcu a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80 of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cybercrime bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time\\n\\nthe storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to cd floppy disk memory stick or flash card other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric logins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employees privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff that is not the case said tim ellsmore managing director of 3ami it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added\\nvirus poses as christmas email\\n\\nsecurity firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card\\n\\nthe zafid virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected email antivirus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online antivirus firm sophos said that 10 of the email currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus\\n\\nlike many other windows viruses zafid plunders microsoft outlook for email addresses and then uses mailsending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug the attachment on the email poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces\\n\\nthe virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the email address the infected message has been sent to the message in the body of the email reads happy holidays and this too is translated on infected machines the virus tries to disable antivirus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary the original zafi virus appeared in april this year we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads fsecures antivirus team\\nnew delay hits eu software laws\\n\\na fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computerbased inventions\\n\\nthe draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact opensource software innovation there was at one point the intention to put the item on todays agenda but in the end we could not put it on an eu spokesman told the reuters agency he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law\\n\\nin december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting poland is a large eu member so its backing for the legislation is vital the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted this means that the usbased amazoncom holds a patent for its oneclick shopping service critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing\\nsavvy searchers fail to spot ads\\n\\ninternet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits\\n\\nthe report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine it also shows that few can spot the difference between paidfor results and organic ones the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online\\n\\nalmost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 19 webpages for each hunt a significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find\\n\\nsearch engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it according to pew research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes a small number 17 said they wouldnt really miss search engines if they did not exist the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites more than twothirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paidfor results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference\\ngames firms face tough future\\n\\nuk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns\\n\\nfred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox 2 will be released in the us before the end of 2005\\n\\nthe new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games mr hasson said in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers he said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said\\n\\nmr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website  codemasters climax and rebellion\\n\\nas consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far each one has involved the death of some people all companies said they were investing in new tools  called middleware  in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control\\n\\nsimon gardner president of climaxs action studio said we are investing in superior tools and editors we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams its vital we avoid huge teams he said climax was already directing about 20 of its resources to preparation for next generation titles mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more businesslike there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days some of them are still making games for peer group approval  that has to stop\\nmicrosoft makes antipiracy move\\n\\nmicrosoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features\\n\\nthe windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid2005 it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be limited microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsofts site those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and addons that the software giant offers\\n\\npeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number\\n\\nmicrosofts regular patches which it releases for newlyfound security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating pcs some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats with more pcs left unprotected but graham cluley senior consultant at security firm sophos told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net he said windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for englishlanguage versions of windows\\n\\nmicrosofts windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time software piracy has cost the company billions it says the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware which 90 of pcs are infected with the virusfighting program updated monthly is a precursor to microsofts dedicated antivirus software last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project a ukbased pilot scheme which ran from november to december the scheme meant that anyone with preinstalled copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china norway and the czech republic where pirated software is a huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows china in particular is a problem with piracy estimated at 92 said mr cluley\\nnintendo handheld given euro date\\n\\nnintendos new handheld console the ds will launch in europe on 11 march the company has announced\\n\\nthe portable games machine which features touchscreen control will retail for £99 in the uk 149 euros nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch with prices ranging from £19 to £29 more than 28 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004 rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console the psp in the us and europe before the end of march the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market despite sonys assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers\\n\\nthe 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendos super mario 64 ds as well as titles from thirdparty developers such as ubisofts rayman ds\\n\\nmore than 120 games are in development for the new console nintendo has said the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance allowing the earlier machines back catalogue of 700 games to be played additionally a shortrange wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds with a download play option which allows a group to play against each other even if just one person owns a copy other features include a shortrange messaging application called pictochat and a builtin microphone which is used in segas launch title project rub nintendo has also announced a media adapter which will allow the console to play music and video on the move\\n\\nthe launch price of £99 149 euros compares favourably with the us price of 149 according to john houlihan editor of the computerandvideogamescom magazine its a very very competitive price point there are some innovative features and nintendo has created quite a buzz he says however the lineup of games could have been stronger everyone wanted to see the eightplayer mario kart ds for example\\n\\nmr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sonys new psp with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device the psp is a sexy bit of kit but sonys attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe so far mr houlihan said the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of 26bn at the end of 2004 according to industry analysts screen digest\\n\\nin the past games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch europe is an extremely important market for nintendo mr iwata added nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks\\nsmart search lets art fans browse\\n\\nif you dont know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting\\n\\nartgarden developed by bts research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works\\n\\nthe technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement 19th century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tates digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didnt have a clue what i wanted he said the textbased search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead\\n\\nhe thinks the dominance of textbased searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you dont arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldnt have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films\\nwarning over windows word files\\n\\nwriting a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm workshare\\n\\nup to 75 of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed to make matters worse 90 of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding\\n\\nsensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said andrew pearson european boss of workshare which commissioned the research the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too he said the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes as documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits microsoft however does provide an addon tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem the remove hidden data addin is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application says the instructions on microsofts website microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document a tool for apple machines running word is not available workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average 31 of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to threequarters fell in to the high risk category often said mr pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared\\n\\nhowever the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this socalled metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated the research revealed that a documents metadata could be substantial as on average only 40 of contributors changes to a document make it to the final draft problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said mr pearson\\nnet regulation still possible\\n\\nthe blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said\\n\\ncontent on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tvquality video online becomes a norm at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options lord currie chairman of superregulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation\\n\\nthe challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or selfregulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion\\n\\nsome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said\\n\\nin fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002 this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several highprofile legal cases richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net the bbcs planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said\\n\\none of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign if content is ondemand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it there is no watershed on the net said mr burke\\nvoters flock to blog awards site\\n\\nvoting is under way for the annual bloggies

technology are currently only available in the windows version opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create style sheets its developers say this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users\\n\\nanother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling\\n\\nthe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people our idea was to take a first step in making humancomputer interaction more natural said ms hanson people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more handsfree experience unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone the voice recognition function is currently only available in english opera is free to download but a paidfor version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand

which played little universal media discs and came before the ipod even played video the vita was a smartphoneage game handheld that tried to up the game further it had an oled touchscreen it had a

campaign to clamp down on movie filesharing aimed at parents\\n\\nthe movie association for americas mpaa free parent file scan software lets parents check their childrens computers for peertopeer programs it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive parents then have the choice to remove programs and files the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files said dan glickman mpaa chief many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where theyve downloaded it from\\n\\nbut some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them movie piracy cost the industry £37bn 7bn in 2003 according to analysts the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat the deleterious effects of peertopeer software including such common problems as viruses trojan horses and identity theft\\n\\nmr glickman said that the film industry was embracing digital age technologies like movielink and cinemanow which are legal movie sites but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive he added the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movieswappers across the us but did not say how many were being sued its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004 it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent edonkey and directconnect peertopeer networks the first convictions for peertopeer piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to

months look like they are going to be a lot of fun\\n\\nthe relentless pace of development in the hitech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year to begin with 2005 will be the year that thirdgeneration 3g mobile phones become inescapable the 3 network launched in 2003 vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and tmobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005 the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up\\n\\nalready the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and ill write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel\\n\\ninstead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multimegapixel devices go on sale

awd sedans stack up\\nthe battle of the premium allwheel drive sedans heats up with the debut of acuras updated tlx\\nthe acura tlx certainly has its fans but over the years it and its predecessors have struggled for legitimacy against the established premium european competition the new 2021 tlx that officially debuted thursday aims to change that with sharp physicality and a promising pair of turbocharged engine options lets see how acuras new sport sedan stacks up against the premium competition\\n\\nthe usual suspects are here audis newly announced 2021 a4 the bmw 330i the mercedesbenz c300 and were also including the volvo s60 another underdog in this class like the audi and the volvo the 2021 tlx features standard frontwheel drive the bimmer and benz send their power to the rear all five sedans are available with optional allwheeldrive so well be looking at those configurations to level the playing field\\npowertrain\\nthe upcoming tlx type s is certainly exciting with its 30liter turbo v6 but acura hasnt yet announced details or specs for that model so well have to circle back on that comparo later for now lets focus on the standard powertrain a 20liter turbocharged fourcylinder mated to a 10speed automatic transmission this is the same vtec turbo engine found in acuras rdx crossover with 272 horsepower and 280 poundfeet of torque in this presumably lighter chassis it should feel more responsive\\n\\nthe tlx claims the highest horsepower in its core competitive set according to acura and technically thats true the a4 3 series and c300 are all members of the around250horsepower club however for this allwheeldrive comparison we have to look at the volvo s60 t6 awd which  with its supercharged and turbocharged engine  raises the bar to 316 ponies if youre feeling the need for speed maybe check out the swede\\nacura has not stated fuel economy estimates for the newgeneration tlx but we can make an educated guess based on the rdxs numbers the crossover is good for 21 city 27 highway and 23 combined miles per gallon in the sedans presumably lighter chassis we should expect slightly better numbers\\n\\nitll need that extra efficiency to ascend from its previous spot near the bottom of the pile the volvo s60 the most powerful of the bunch is for now the least efficient competitor with 21 city mpg 32 highway mpg and 25 mpg combined  still better than the 2019 tlx slightly better is the mercedesbenz c300 at 26 combined mpg audi hasnt released numbers for its 2021 a4 but we dont think itll be too far off of the 2020 models 27 combined mpg \\n\\nthe current king of the hill is the bmw 330i xdrive at 25 city 34 highway and 28 combined mpg frankly we dont think the acura will beat that but if the tlx manages to land in the middle of the pack itll still be a solid step up over last year\\nthe tlxs new look  based on the type s concept  is wrapped around a new platform that is longer and wider than before the wheelbase also stretches to 1130 inches a gain of 37 inches interestingly the roof sits 06inch lower 564 than last year which contributes to the wide and low look\\n\\nthe tlx is now the longest model in this roundup measuring over 7 inches longer than the next longest audi a4 and over 10 inches longer than the cclass the acuras 113inch wheelbase is also one of the longest in the class acuras tlx has long straddled the size spectrum between these compact sedans and their midsize counterparts\\n\\nwith 135 cubic feet of trunk space the tlx lands right in the middle of the pack the bmw has the biggest boot in the bunch at 17 cubic feet while s60 drivers make do with just 116 cubes interestingly the volvo is the broadest sedan at 803 inches  about 5 inches wider than the acura  if wide bois are a

on the links below\\n\\nif you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokias ngage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset\\n\\nand given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles\\n\\nthere are shootemups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tiein increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5 what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available  even the ones that use 3d graphics\\n\\nthe minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth shortrange radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing\\n\\n too fast too furious digital bridges \\n\\nas soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games  because im rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via

through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoonlike but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right powerup you can go into a matrixstyle bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens

makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california\\n\\nfrom 1 january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate\\n\\none form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer users websurfing it can result in people being bombarded with popup ads that are hard to close in washington congress has been debating four antispyware bills but california is a step ahead the states consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware consumers are able to seek up to 1000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90 of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and

websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts highprofile web portals such as google yahoo ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations so many were visiting some aidrelated sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee dec has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible the site has so far received almost £8 million with more than 11000 donations being made online every hour\\n\\ntelco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations it has also provided space in londons bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations\\n\\nsome of the webs biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made among the 17 organisations listed are oxfam medecins sans frontieres doctors without borders and network for good many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort sadly the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in antifraud organisations are warning about emails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies\\nmobiles rack up 20 years of use\\n\\nmobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend\\n\\nbritains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline\\n\\nthe first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about £2000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes\\n\\ndespite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular\\nblogs take on the mainstream\\n\\nweb logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow\\n\\nthese online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eyewitness account of events most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics the most wellknown examples include iraqi salam paxs accounts of the usled war former iranian vicepresident mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republics government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign there are already websites pulling together these firsthand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinewscom launched last november\\n\\nthe blogging movement has been building up for many years\\n\\nandrew nachison director of the media center a usbased thinktank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says and blogs were a key part of that transformation among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bushs victory and the responses from his supporters mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website but they followed the story they didnt lead it\\n\\nsome parts of the socalled traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs\\n\\nothers like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content i dont think the mission and role of journalism is threatened it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper the onetomany road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides whats acceptable for public consumption and what isnt thats gone forever with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories\\n\\nit seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger\\n\\nbut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the socalled blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels tools such as googles blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog us research thinktank pew internet  american life says a blog is created every 58 seconds although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison and theres going to be bad that comes with the good\\n\\x1a'"
